## Ultimate Guide to the Nomad 65W Slender Charger: Essential for Modern Travelers

### Key Takeaways

* The Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter is incredibly small and slim thanks to GaN technology.
* It is not only small, but also powerful, with multiple ports for charging devices. It can replace most laptop chargers and charge a second device.
* The downward-facing ports on the power adapter allow it to stay plugged into wall outlets securely, avoiding the frustration of loose connections. It is a great addition to any travel pouch and worth considering as a replacement for laptop power bricks.

 I love ambitious gadgets and technology, but mostly I just want the power adapters charging my electronics to get smaller and work faster. The [Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000765%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fac-adapter-65w-usb-c-slim) does just that. It’s an inconceivably small travel solution for road warriors or a way for homebodies to fast-charge using an outlet tucked behind a couch.

##  How Small Can a 65W Power Adapter Get?

![Nomad 65W Slim adapter next to a library card](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/nomad-65w-slim-adapter-next-to-a-library-card.JPG)

A library card leaning up against the 65W Slim Power Adapter

 The Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter is smaller in width and height than a credit card—or library card—and manages this by using GaN technology. Its thickness is just beyond what’s needed to accommodate the recessed prongs and house two USB-C ports. There is no fat on this steak.

 It felt impossibly small to hold in my hand, especially for how much power it was capable of producing. It’s just bigger than a Zippo lighter, so I could comfortably fit it in the front pocket of my jeans. By comparison, the 67W power adapter from Apple, with a single USB-C port, did not fit in my pants pocket.

 Not only is it tiny, but it includes multiple ports. When used solo, the device packs the full 65 watts of power. Used in a pair, one port pushes 45 watts, while the other gives 20 watts.

 Once I got my hands on this charger, I desperately tried to talk to my family about its size and power, but they weren't interested. I was stressing to them that this thing I had in the palm of my hand could replace most laptop chargers—and charge a second device. They weren’t getting it.

 So, in a last-ditch effort, I collected as many adapters as I could carry and stacked them next to each other for the visual effect. That got my daughter’s attention (briefly). Below are some comparisons, which still, surprisingly, don’t quite do the device's size justice. Among the adapters pictured are ones from Nomad, Apple, [Belkin](http://belkin.com), [Sharge](https://sharge.com/), and [Twelve South](http://twelvesouth.com).

##  A Power Adapter That Doesn’t Fall Out of a Wall Socket

![Nomad 65W Slim power adapter plugged into outlet above Apple 67W adapter](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/nomad-65w-slim-power-adapter-plugged-into-outlet-above-apple-67w-adapter.JPG)

The Nomad 65W Slim charger above a 67W Apple charger

 It’s incredibly frustrating to search for a wall outlet only to find that your heavy power adapter won’t stay plugged into it. None of them should be too heavy to support their own weight with their metal prongs. That’s a big reason I’m a fan of the downward-facing ports on power adapters. Those types of adapters, like the 65W Slim, can hug the wall tighter without as much force pulling them away.

 I tried to find the loosest wall sockets around my house to confirm the slim design of this Nomad power adapter still functioned in those outlets. It did.

 While everything came up roses with this product, it does have the consideration that on some powerstrips, full of existing cables, it may be too wide to slide into a last open spot. That’s probably also a consideration of the [20W Apple charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHJA3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter), too—which the Nomad one is just a hair wider than.

##  Price and Availability

 The Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter is available now for $65\. The [35W version](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000765%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fac-adapter-35w-usb-c-slim) only has one USB-C port, but is smaller and retails for $35\. (See a pattern?) I tried that one, too, and if the higher power or extra port aren’t compelling, I would opt for the 35W model, which is even more compact.

 If you want a narrower power adapter for a specific reason, [Nomad has those too](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000765%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fac-adapter-30w-usb-c).

 Beyond traveling, though, I think anyone with a laptop that can charge via USB-C should replace the power brick that came with their device with this one. Yes, $65 is a premium price, but its slim figure and light weight will still be valuable for some people.
