## Streamline Cinematography Processes Using OBS's Versatile LUT Tools and Downloads

We've all seen filters on social media that change the appearance or feel of your photos. They might even improve your appearance. You can use an identical impact on video, and these are known as LUTs. In OBS, you can add them to a video or your webcam, which will change your face cam's appearance or increase its quality.

## Why do we need to use LUTs in OBS Studio?

Color grading presets called to look up tables can be used in video editing applications and OBS. They can be utilized to alter the tone of your photo or just add to its vibrancy. LUTs allow you to apply filters to your image in order to increase its quality or produce a dramatic effect. It may even save you money on a more expensive camera. Here are some reasons why you should use LUTs.

### 1\. It brings perfection with time management

LUTs aid in pleasing the client, completing the job on time, and achieving magnificent cinematic hues. A LUT is easy to use and only requires a few clicks. Whether lifestyle, personal, or business, some projects might take a long time to edit. Some projects have a very tight schedule, and editing can even be done overnight! LUTs come in handy in this situation. Most experts have had clients who demand video as soon as possible but have no idea how long it takes to create a video! It takes a lot longer than they anticipate.

However, you still want to provide a good project; color grading might take a long time to go through all of the clips and make them appear beautiful, and you may not have the time. Here, LUTs can definitely help.

### 2\. It provides a polished finish

Lookup tables might save you time when editing, but for many creative filmmakers and editors, LUTs are a way of polishing the final appearance of a film. When color grading is poorly done, it can impair the aesthetic of a movie and distract the audience. The beautiful thing about LUTs is that most of them on the market are created by other videographers, so you know they'll work on your movies right out of the box; all you have to do is make little tweaks to match the vision you have in your brain. If you've never used LUTs before but want to take your short films to an extraordinary level, try cinematic LUTs, which will give you that blockbuster vibe on a budget.

### 3\. A command to adaptability

They're highly adaptable. LUTs can be utilized to convert Log film back to the Rec709 standard, making the Log color profile more approachable to users who don't have years of color grading expertise. Professionals generally employ log color space to increase dynamic range and sustain shadows and highlights in contrasting scenes. Conversion LUTs now assist in getting over the arduous task of color grading Log footage.

Many pros and amateurs use conversion LUTs to make this step considerably easier. Many LUTs, notably creative LUTs, are compatible with a video that has been converted to Rec709 from Log. For use on Rec709 standard color film, creative LUTs typically preserve the cinematic and stylish colors. Rec709 is the most common color profile used by most cameras, making it the easiest to work with.

### 4\. It gives a hint of professionalism

Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, and other programs can use LUTs. They're ideal for any video where you want to create a distinct appearance or vibe. LUTs are essential for any aspiring or established filmmaker. They're utilized to quickly create high-quality visuals that give any project a polished look. They can also be used to give your video an overall color tone.

### 5\. Creativity at your fingertips

LUTs are a quick and easy way to achieve colors. Consider LUTs to be color grading professionals who share their knowledge via a LUT file. They do all of the heavy lifting, so you don't have to. Of course, some modifications may be necessary to make it suit perfectly with your camera video, but this is far easier than conducting the color grading process yourself, mainly if you aren't interested in learning how to color grade yet or just don't have the time.

Specifically, you need to acquire intricate color grading tools that are difficult to grasp if you haven't used them before. Pros even use LUTs in feature films. So don't think they're just for folks who don't want to color grade; they're utilized across the board in filmmaking.

Professionals utilize them to get a rough concept of how the film will look after the final grade is completed by looking at the monitors they use. LUTs are simply temporary file that instructs the computer to go from one set of colors to another. As a result, the professionals' expertise can be readily kept in this file and distributed to everyone who uses them.
