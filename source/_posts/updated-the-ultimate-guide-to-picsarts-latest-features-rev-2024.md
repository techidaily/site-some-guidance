**Magic Effects:** PicsArt allows you the opportunity to create beautiful artwork out of a photo through its AI-powered filter.

This is a whole new level from what you see with other photo editor apps with AI-powered filters.

**Drawing Tool:** with over 20 brush types that translate on a 3D plane, PicsArt has given artists the go-ahead to create amazing, beautiful works of art using the app. It photoshop-layers gives you the feeling of drawing on photoshop.
