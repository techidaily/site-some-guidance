## What is AVI Format?

AVI is an abbreviation for Audio Video Interleaved media file format. It contains audio and video information in digital form so that playbacks can be organised. AVI can handle wide range of compressed digital data that comes from several codecs like XviD and DivX etc. AVI files generally have two parts where first one contains details about frame rates, file size and other characteristics, it is named as Header. On the other side the second portion contains chunks of information from audio and video world.
