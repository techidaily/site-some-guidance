 Do you sometimes find your laptop touchpad to be a nuisance? Perhaps you're using an external mouse or simply don't want the cursor to fly across the screen due to an accidental touch. Whatever the reason, there are a few different ways to disable the touchpad on a Windows 11 laptop.

##  How to Turn Off Your Windows 11 Touchpad

[Windows offers various touchpad gestures](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/picture-perfection-ranking-of-photo-grid-tools/) that make navigating your device a cakewalk. However, if you want more accuracy and better ergonomics, use an [external mouse](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/directly-send-snaps-from-your-phone-a-tutorial-for-2024/).

 To use an external mouse or trackpad, you must turn off the built-in touchpad to avoid compatibility issues, [accidental clicks](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-personalize-your-discord-presence-adding-custom-emojis-easily/), and cursor moments. Here are five ways to disable your Windows 11 touchpad.

###  1\. Disable the Touchpad By Pressing Its Dedicated Key

 The quickest way to turn off your Windows 11 touchpad is to press its dedicated key. Many laptop manufacturers provide a dedicated [function key](https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-14-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/) to manage your touchpad.

 Simply press that key in combination with the Fn key to turn off your touchpad. The key will be different for different manufacturers, but the general rule of thumb is to look for a function key that has a touchpad logo on it. Refer to your device manual if you're unsure.

 After disabling the touchpad, you will see a confirmation message on your screen saying, "TouchPad is disabled."

 To enable the touchpad, press that function key again with the Fn key.

###  2\. Disable the Touchpad Using the Settings App

 If your device doesn't have a dedicated key to disable the touchpad, you can [use the Windows Settings app](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-easy-ways-to-multiply-your-youtube-follower-base/). Press Windows+i to open the Settings app, click "Bluetooth & devices" in the left sidebar, then "Touchpad" in the right pane.

 On this screen, turn off the toggle next to "Touchpad".

 You'll now see that the [touchpad has stopped working](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-oppo-a79-5g-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/). To enable the touchpad again in the future, simply turn on the "Touchpad" toggle.

###  3\. Disable the Touchpad Using the Control Panel

 Although Microsoft is gradually moving all [Control Panel](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/seamless-media-exchange-transferring-facebook-content-to-whatsapp-for-2024/) options to the Settings app, there are still a few Windows settings that you can manage from the Control Panel, such as disabling your touchpad.

 Open the Start menu and type "Control Panel" in the search bar, then hit Enter. Click "Hardware and Sound" in the Control Panel and then "Mouse".
