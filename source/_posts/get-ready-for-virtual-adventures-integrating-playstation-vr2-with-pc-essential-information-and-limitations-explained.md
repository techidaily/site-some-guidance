## Get Ready for Virtual Adventures: Integrating PlayStation VR2 with PC - Essential Information and Limitations Explained

The PlayStation VR2 was designed for playing VR games on the PlayStation 5, but there have been rumors for a while that it could be updated to work on PCs as well. Sony has now confirmed PC support, but there are a few catches.

 Sony just announced the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter, which will be available starting August 7 for $60 in the United States (€60 in Europe, £50 in the UK). It will allow the existing PlayStation VR2 headset to be used with gaming PCs through SteamVR. Sony has also created a desktop application for customizing the settings and play area.

 Sony said in a press release, “When PlayStation VR2 launched last year, we were thrilled to introduce PS5 players to a new generation of VR games with innovative gameplay and immersive sensory features. Inspired by our passion to bring gamers even more content options, we’ve been working to enable access to additional games on PC, complementing the diverse PS VR2 games lineup available on PS5\. Today, we’re happy to share that we’ll be rolling out this support on August 7.”

 The PlayStation VR2 has a 4K resolution (2000 x 2040 per eye), a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and pass-through support on both PlayStation 5 and PC. Sony says foveated rendering and 3D audio will be available on PC in some games. However, support for HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptative triggers, and haptic feedback (except for basic rumble) won’t work on PC. There aren’t many PC games that can take advantage of those features, but it’s still disappointing that the VR2 will be a more limited experience on PC.

 Sony is likely adding PC support to help boost sales numbers for the VR2, since it [hasn’t lived up to the company’s expectations](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/sony-reportedly-halts-psvr2-production-amid-slow-sales/). The new PC support is especially helpful for people with both a PlayStation 5 and gaming PC, since they can now use one headset to play VR games on both platforms, but the headset might also be compelling for PC-only play. Meta is the market leader for PC VR headsets—the latest [Steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) reported 53% of VR players have a Quest 2 or Quest 3—but not everyone is a fan of that company after its [many documented privacy problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuits%5Finvolving%5FMeta%5FPlatforms).

 The VR2 is currently [priced at $450](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003462&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplaystation-vr2-will-soon-work-with-pc%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and the adapter will cost $60 when it arrives in August, bringing the total for PC players to around $510\. That’s more expensive than the Quest 2 or Quest 3, which also have the advantage of standalone modes, but the VR2 is higher resolution and isn’t sold by a company with a history of repeated privacy violations. The next step up in PC VR would be a Valve Index or HTC Vive system, which cost over $1,000 and use more complex (but more accurate) room sensors.
