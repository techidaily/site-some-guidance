As the first point, the **macOS Big Sur update** will allow you to switch to a Mac with Apple’s ARM-based chip shortly. Also, you get the ability to run iOS apps on Mac that is the first time in Apple history.

Here are the reasons to find why a Big Sur upgrade worth trying for:

You can also [click here to get it from the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12)

**Step 2: Install the update**

After the download, the installer will open automatically, whereby clicking the “Continue” option, follow the onscreen instructions.

2. **Stay up-to-date:** Downloading or installing the **macOS Big Sur upgrade**isn’t a great deal, but being up-to-date is mandatory. Checking the system preferences or notifications regarding macOS Big Sure can help you.
3. **Learn about app compatibility:** Apart from system or hardware compatibility, learning about 32-bit app compatibility is mandatory when the installer shows a list of apps not optimized for your Mac. Based on it, you can proceed to the installation process.
