## Part 1: What are SRT subtitles?

Before we proceed to the main discussion of the day, it'll be necessary to understand what SRT subtitles are first.

SRT Subtitles (SubRip subtitles) are text formats that are generated from DVD-ripping software SubRip. Most companies and content creators today use them in their videos to facilitate easy understanding of their videos. Thus, allowing their videos to get higher engagement and views.

## Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?

To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don't require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.

That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio/dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.

The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;

Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.

![create a new file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg)

Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;

* Type 1 > under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;

_1_

* _00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:11,834_

The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.

Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.

Step4 Repeat steps 2&3 for the remaining subtitle contents.

Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;

_1_

_00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:11,834_

_Hello, and welcome to our presentation._

_2_
