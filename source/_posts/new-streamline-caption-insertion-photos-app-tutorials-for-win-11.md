But, the Windows 10 Photos app feature offers an add-on for creating video from your phone’s media. Let’s learn how to add titles/text to video on Photos in Windows 10.

* Select the best-animated text fonts to suit the background. There are different layouts for each of the font style. Preview the animation by using Playback Control. If the text is not animating, you may try to increase the duration to 3-4 seconds that works well
* For addition of credits, try to use the Classic text style. Put each of the credits in a new line and do give credits to yourself as well
