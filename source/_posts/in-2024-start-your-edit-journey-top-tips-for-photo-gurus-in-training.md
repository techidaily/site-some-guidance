### 1\. Tip 1: Sky Replacement

Do you know that Photoshop image editing can easily replace the sky in your picture with a single click? To use this feature, navigate to "Edit" and then click on "Sky Replacement." This feature will open its dialog box from which you can easily choose the sky displayed in the "Sky List."

You can also edit the edges of your sky by heading to "Shift Edge Slider," from where you can fade in or out the sky edges using the slider. To adjust the brightness, saturation, and temperature of the sky, use the option of "Sky Adjustments." Keep in mind that Photoshop has two lightning modes that are "Multiple" and "Screen." Multiply mode is used for dark effects, and Screen mode is used for bright effects on the picture.
