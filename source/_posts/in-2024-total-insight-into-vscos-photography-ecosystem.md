### 8\. Adjust the Intensity of Filters

Filters are the best thing present in every photo editor. However, VSCO edits are different than any ordinary photo editor as it gives the option to control the intensity of your picture in each filter. Thus, you can add layers of filters to your image and adjust their intensity according to your will.
