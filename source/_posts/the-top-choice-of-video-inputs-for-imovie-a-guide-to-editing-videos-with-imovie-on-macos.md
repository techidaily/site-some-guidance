![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

iMovie'11 (Version 9.0), as part of the iLife'11 package, has the ability to make trailers for home movies, more control over audio, instant replay and flash. It now supports the AVCHD Lite format (a subset of AVCHD format limited to 720p60, 720p50 and 720p24). 

The above table shows the commonly-used video formats that iMovie supports. Yet, if you hunger for the best video format for iMovie, tell you the truth, I'm afraid that there is no exactly the best video format for this Apple video editor software, since to great extent it counts on the versions of your macOS and iMovie. 

Supposed you have installed iMovie'08 on Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5, you can practically only upload or export video files in Apple MPEG-4 or QuickTime MOV. In case you own iMovie'09 on Mac OS X 10.5/10.6 or iMovie'11 on Mac OS X 10.7 (or higher), then luckily, they support a slightly wider range of input video formats like the standard MP4, MOV and DV. 

Until now you may find it's a little bit troublesome to find out the best video format for your iMovie, and you wonder if only there is a solid tool to help you to convert any video to iMovie best video format regardless of iMovie version and operating systems. Fortunately, Here [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can deliver you a whopping help.
