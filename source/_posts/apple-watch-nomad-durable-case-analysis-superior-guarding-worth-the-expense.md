##  Nomad Rugged Case: Can It Make All Apple Watches Ultras?

 The Nomad Rugged Case takes its design cues from the [Apple Watch Ultra](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-bandicam-in-depth-review-for-the-modern-user/) and [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-youtube-pinpointing-a-specialized-audience/) since it has an Ultra Orange button that's changeable with a black button. These are anodized stainless steel buttons that protect the Apple Watch button from scratches.

 Beyond this, the case is made from hardened 315L stainless steel with 1000 HV DLC coating. The combination would seem to add more protection to the Apple Watch's body. Inside the case is a protective TPU lining that's soft to the touch and should be highly durable.

 Adding the Nomad Rugged Case to the Apple Watch inevitably adds some bulk, as the stainless steel body measures 42mm by 57mm by 11mm. And yet, it doesn't feel heavy. The added bulk does nothing to negatively affect access to the watch's Digital Crown or button. Touch navigation is also not affected.

##  The Rugged Band: Easy On and Off

 The Nomad Rugged Case for Apple Watch includes a waterproof fluoroelastomer (FKM) band that's sturdy, durable, and feels good around the wrist. The high-performance synthetic rubber is said to resist abrasion, heat, and chemicals.

 The band includes custom stainless steel lugs and a buckle to ensure a secure fit. The buckle side of the band measures 77mm in length, while the adjustment side is 120mm, making it suitable for plenty of wrist sizes. Additionally, the band features eight lug holes to accommodate different-sized arms.

##  Nomad Rugged Case for Apple Watch: Supports Many Models

 The Nomad Rugged Case works with 44mm and 45mm Apple Watches sizes. This means it will work with the larger-sized Series 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and SE models. Nomad did not make a Rugged Case for smaller Apple Watch models, and this one doesn't support either Apple Watch Ultra model.

##  Nomad Rugged Case: Price and Availability

 The biggest drawback to the Nomad Rugged Case is the price. At $120, it's a costly Apple Watch case and band combination. Companies like [Casetify](https://www.casetify.com/gadgets/apple-watch-case?DG=Accessories&D%5FAccessories=Apple+Watch+Case), [OtterBox](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001894/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/apple-watch), and others offer Apple Watch cases without bands for much less. However, these cases aren't necessarily as durable. Currently, the Nomad case is exclusively available through the Nomad website.

 If you can get past the price, the [Nomad Rugged Case for Apple Watch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2001894%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-apple-watch-black) is an excellent solution for anyone who wants to add more durability and protection to their wearable device.
