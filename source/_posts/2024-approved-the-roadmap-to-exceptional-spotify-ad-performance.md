## The Roadmap to Exceptional Spotify Ad Performance

Want a break from the ads? This is a famous phrase that we've all heard when listening to music on a free Spotify account. It's one of the most famous Spotify ads on the planet.

Spotify ads are incredibly effective because the platform's audience is super attentive. This means they will listen and understand your message. It is also easy to target specific audiences and get your message heard by the right people.

In this guide, we'll uncover all of their secrets and learn how to create successful ad campaigns on Spotify.

1. [Audio Ads](#part2-1)
2. [Spotify Video Ads](#part2-2)
3. [Overlay Ads (Display Ads)](#part2-3)
4. [Sponsored List](#part2-4)

* [Successful Examples of Spotify Ads](#part3)

## Why Should You Use Spotify Ads?

![spotify logo on newspaper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spotify-ads-1.jpg)

Spotify currently has over[430 million active users](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/) every single month. A little over 50% of those users don't have Spotify premium. This means they will be exposed to ads. So, you have a potential audience of over 200 million people.

[23% of all recorded users](https://headphonesaddict.com/listening-to-music-statistics/) use a streaming service like Spotify to listen to music. This is the highest percentage compared to all other methods of listening to music. The most common devices used are a car's radio and smartphones.

Additionally, Spotify's ads system is quite effective. Most of their free-plan users expect to hear ads. Therefore, they are prepared and will listen through the entire ad while focusing on the message.

These are more than enough reasons to understand the potential of Spotify ads.

Also, did you know that you can create several ads on Spotify that differ significantly? Yes, there are four significant types of Spotify ads.

## 4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)

We already discussed the incredible potential and exposure ads on Spotify can bring. Now, it's time to find out what type of ad will be ideal in your case.

### Audio Ads

Any guide to Spotify ads will tell you that their audio ads are the easiest to create. Anyone can make them. You must record a 15-30 second audio clip sharing your message.

Spotify's Ad Studio offers fantastic tools to help you create your ads. You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.

The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.

Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That's when it will play your audio ad.

### Spotify Video Ads

Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.

Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.

There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions. Choosing the one that's right for you can significantly increase conversions.

**Takeover ads** pop up when you're actively going through Spotify and its music catalogues. **Sponsored Sessions** are video ads that let you watch them in exchange for 30 minutes of ad-free music.

Compared to Spotify audio ads, video ads offer a few advantages:

* Video ads play unmuted and allow for a more visual presentation of what is being advertised
* They can be displayed when users are actively using the app
* Each video ad can grant you the chance to use Spotify ad-free for 30 minutes per ad watched

### Overlay Ads (Display Ads)

These ads do not have audio or video in them at all. They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.

Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that's when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.

### Sponsored List

Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify. You may create playlists of songs that best relate to your brand. You can also include visuals and graphics that clearly promote your brand.

Additionally, users will be shown more of your ads whenever they pause the playlist you are sponsoring.

## Successful Examples of Spotify Ads

After introducing the types of Spotify ads, to help you have a deeper understanding of it, we have chosen two successful examples of Spotify ads for you. Hopefully, you can have more confidence in Spotify Ads. Don't be afraid to try new ideas and find what works for you.

### 1\. PizzaHut

You may have stumbled upon a[Pizza Hut ad](https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/inspiration/pizza-hut-ad-studio-case-study/) on Spotify featuring background sounds that resemble a soccer match. This was an Audio Ad and was targeted on Pizza Hut's fans of parents, and soccer and gaming enthusiasts, all of which congregated on Spotify.

The ad surpassed the average ad metrics on Spotify, gaining a whopping 0.23% CTR from sports fans and a 0.54% CTR from gaming enthusiasts and parents.

### 2\. RXBAR

Another successful campaign a popular brand did with Spotify ads is RXBAR.[This particular campaign](https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/inspiration/rxbar-gets-healthy-boost-from-playful-campaign/) did not have one type of ad, not two, but seven different variations.

![rxbar ads on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spotify-ads-3.jpg)

This includes audio ads, display ads, video takeovers, sponsored sessions, homepage takeovers, sponsored playlists, and overlay.

Here's the result of all of their ad types combined:

* 42% increase in brand awareness
* 243% lift in recall of their ads
* 52% message association

It shows how much creativity is involved in creating a successful Spotify ads campaign.
