![make meme with ps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-meme-with-ps.jpg)

Here's how to create memes on your computer using only Photoshop CC. Choose a photo and **make it a meme** with these steps.

* **Create document:** Before starting your Photoshop, check the social platform for desired dimensions and format. For this, you can start with a size of 1080px X1080px. It is a standard image used for Instagram. You can even use Artboards for creating templates, and that's what you must make sure that they are made in the new document.
* **Select image:** The meme's popularity is based chiefly on image strength, which usually relies on humor to draw attention. You can add the image to photoshop in several ways. You can open the picture in your application, select, copy and paste it on the canvas. You can find even important pictures directly to the file or use the drag and drop option. You can select **the face you make a meme** with**.**
* **Make your background:** No meme is completed without the proper background. The background is crucial to make the content attractive. You will have to create new layers with the shortcut "Cmd+Shift+N" and then drag this to the bottom layer, go to the Edit, and click on Fill. You can see numerous options in the menu, selecting the pattern and then choosing a custom pattern.
* **Add Text:** In the end, a meme's appearance serves as a vehicle for its message. The writing should be boldly extensive and assertive next to the image, compromising style for effect. To create a box across the canvas, use the Type tool. Aim for a structure with one significant remark and a lesser message below by keeping the wording extensive and straightforward.

## 3\. Use Canva

You may completely personalize your meme using our drag-and-drop editor; there are no restrictions on watermarks, fonts, or flexible designs.
