* **Resolution:** The major problem of maximum cameras is their poor resolution and picture clarity especially when they are mounted on helmet or moving objects. Try to ensure resolution of at least 1080p or prefer to find one with 4K quality.
* **Memory Capacity:** Few latest models never allows users to insert [memory card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for storage, you have to compromise with the limited internal storage only. Be aware while buying such cameras, it is necessary to have at least 32 GB storage space for better results.
