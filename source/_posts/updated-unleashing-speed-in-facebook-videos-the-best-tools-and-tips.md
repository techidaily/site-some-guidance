## Unleashing Speed in Facebook Videos: The Best Tools and Tips

Facebook is a treasure trove of memories for a lot of people. Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.

Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, **can you speed up Facebook videos** still?

The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let's discuss the **Facebook video speed controller** options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.

## The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook

Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play. One major reason to **speed up Facebook videos** for people is the typical size of this content.

There are no preset options to speed videos, and one might lose out on information when they choose another timestamp to start watching from. In this case, external solutions are useful, like the **Video Speed Controller Facebook** extension, Fast Playback, or third-party apps.

While the previous options we discussed work favorably in changing **Facebook video playback speed**, they are suitable for specific operating systems. So, you have to download and use them on your device separately.

They are also suitable for operating systems like Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. The available features are extensive, and you can use many functions instead of the basic speed change steps.

Next, you can make adjustments to the speed of the video you download offline using Wondershare Filmora. The software is accessible on desktop, in both Mac and Windows devices. Here, you will find many editing functions and features to optimize the quality and look of the videos.

But one of the best areas where Filmora excels is giving its users the ability to change speed easily through different methods. You can increase speed, reverse, or create slow-motion effect easily through the timeline icon for Speed or by double-clicking the video clip and choosing Speed Ramping. All the speed changing methods available here are simple to use and get used to on this software.

The three main speed adjustment methods of Filmora include:

**1\. Uniform Speed**

The most usable method to change the speed of the video you add to Filmora is via Uniform Speed. After inserting the file, you can click on it and drag it to the editor timeline. There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.

**2\. Speed Ramping**

For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon > Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.

There are 6 preset templates available for keyframe-based speed adjustment on this software. You can choose one of the pre-made speed ramp options or customize your personalized speed ramping effect, controlling the keyframes. Adjust the audio pitch as well.

You can select the video clip and click on the icon for speed, shown as a tiny clock. Then, from the drop-down menu, click on Fast option and choose the speed between 2x to 100x.

**A Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up a Video on Filmora**

## Conclusion

Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.

Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.
