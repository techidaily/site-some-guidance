###### Results

#### Solution

* ABBYY’s platform automates the entire invoicing process. It extracts PDFs, captures data from a variety of formats and languages, and extracts a diverse range of ﬁelds.
* After data capture, classiﬁcation extraction and analysis, the data goes through a veriﬁcation station where close to 80% of documents pass through without human touch. Invoices that do not are difficult for even a human processor to understand.
* Documents are then passed to a UiPath robot so that the process ﬂows seamlessly to SAP.

#### Value

* Staff time is now redirected to activities that optimize operations and strengthen the customer experience.
* Improved efficiency and accuracy. Reduction in time to process vendor invoices.
* Better use of ﬁnancial and staff resources.

 “We were looking for a solution that allowed us to not only reduce the time needed to process vendor invoices but one that improved our payment ﬂow. Luckily, ABBYY’s unique platform has an amazing ability to learn and pick out the right data from our invoices. The efﬁciency of ABBYY has allowed our team to work on other projects to keep Accounts Payable as current as the needs of our business change.”
