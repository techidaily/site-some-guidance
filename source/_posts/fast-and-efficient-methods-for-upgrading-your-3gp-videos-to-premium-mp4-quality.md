_Change 3GP to MP4 - I have stuck in this problem for a long time. I couldn't play 3GP video on my iPad. My friends asked me to use a converter to change the format. Handbrake is free software and works well but it doesn't meet my demand. I want a video converter that works well both on high video quality and speed. Thanks for your advice. -- from Forum_
