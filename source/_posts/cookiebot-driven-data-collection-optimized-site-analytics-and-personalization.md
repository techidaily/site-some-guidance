## Nagarro Invoice Scanner for SAP S/4HANA® Delivers Impressive ROI, Powered by ABBYY

![pathner logo](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/customer-stories/white-logos/nagarro_logo_new_white.png?h=30&iar=0&w=120)

Nagarro ES GmbH, a global digital product engineering and technology consulting firm, helps clients become innovative, digital-first companies. Nagarro’s global SAP unit’s Invoice Scanner for SAP S/4HANA® leverages ABBYY intelligent document processing (IDP) to enhance customers’ visibility, like at one of Germany’s largest vehicle manufacturers, into the invoice processing lifecycle with real-time updates for better decision-making and cash flow. 

Since adopting ABBYY Vantage, we’ve seen remarkable improvements. The improved browser UI and very good scanning results have significantly improved our document processing, saving time and resources.

Ulrich Winter, Head of Application Development, Nagarro ES GmbH

### Challenge

Nagarro was looking for advanced technology to power the Invoice Scanner solution for their clients using SAP S/4HANA® for invoice processing. For these clients, invoice data had been copied or typed to a form in SAP S/4HANA. The manual operation sometimes resulted in errors.

Since the majority of invoices are mostly sent as PDF files, the goal was to enable Nagarro Invoice Scanner to scan these files and automatically transfer the data to SAP S/4HANA.

Requirements:

* Read the content of PDF invoices, regardless of format or language
* Interpret this content accurately
* Create an invoice object in SAP S/4HANA®

### Solution

Nagarro used ABBYY Vantage to power the recognition within their Invoice Scanner.

Vantage applies artificial intelligence technology to accurately extract data from documents, using extraction models that provide a low-code approach to using AI. The web browser-based UI for training the system made it easy to manage new types of invoices. Vantage continuously learns the documents, improving results and accuracy.

Customers can use Nagarro’s ROI calculator to see the amount of money saved using their Invoice Scanner over manual methods.
