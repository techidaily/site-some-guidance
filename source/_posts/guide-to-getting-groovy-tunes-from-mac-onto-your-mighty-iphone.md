iTunes is the main method that Apple users use to sync data between iPhone and computer. When someone switches from Android to iOS, upgrade to a new iPhone, add new songs, you can always move the music though iTunes on Wi-Fi or USB cable.

Step 1: Open iTunes and connect your iPhone to Mac.  
 Step 2: Click the Device icon at the upper right corner and select Music from the sidebar.  
 Step 3: Enable Sync Music and decide to sync the entire music library or selected songs. Then click Sync.

### Why is iTunes Not the Best Way to Transfer Music from Mac to iPhone?

iTunes is Apple's default and official tool for the music transfer task and the process seems to be simple. But this doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. In fact, iTunes has posed many errors and limitations when syncing songs from macOS to iPhone.

1\. "Some of the files were not copied to the iPhone because iCloud Music Library is enabled on this phone".  
 2\. iTunes songs are not accessible, greyed out with dotted circles.  
 3\. Can't see "iPhone music library" option in iTunes...  
 4\. Music can't be synced with error codes like -5000, -69, 13010 and error 13014.  
 5\. iPhone music library is messed up with duplicate songs...

• [iTunes won't sync non-Apple music to iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), including music downloaded, ripped from CD, shared with friends.  
 • iTunes will erase the iPhone music that is not stored in the iTunes library.   
 • iTunes won't sync music in formats not supported by Apple.   

 • [iTunes does not sync the music](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) info, let alone batch edit music title, singer, albums, composer and year.

• The jailbroken iPhone 8 can't sync with iTunes, not to mention syncing music from Mac to iPhone.
