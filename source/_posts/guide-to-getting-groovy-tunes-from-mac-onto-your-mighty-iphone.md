### Why is iTunes Not the Best Way to Transfer Music from Mac to iPhone?

iTunes is Apple's default and official tool for the music transfer task and the process seems to be simple. But this doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. In fact, iTunes has posed many errors and limitations when syncing songs from macOS to iPhone.

 2\. iTunes songs are not accessible, greyed out with dotted circles.  
 3\. Can't see "iPhone music library" option in iTunes...  
 4\. Music can't be synced with error codes like -5000, -69, 13010 and error 13014.  
 5\. iPhone music library is messed up with duplicate songs...

• [iTunes won't sync non-Apple music to iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), including music downloaded, ripped from CD, shared with friends.  
 • iTunes will erase the iPhone music that is not stored in the iTunes library.   
 • iTunes won't sync music in formats not supported by Apple.   

 • [iTunes does not sync the music](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) info, let alone batch edit music title, singer, albums, composer and year.
