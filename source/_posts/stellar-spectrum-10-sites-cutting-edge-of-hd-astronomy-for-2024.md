## Stellar Spectrum: 10 Sites Cutting-Edge of HD Astronomy

Whether you are an interior designer or a digital artist, there is no easier way to brighten up a computer-generated scene than using an HDRI. These High Dynamic Range Images have the capability to store more than 8 bits of data per pixel for a larger range of brightness.

HDRIs are a common concept in the CG world to create realistically lit scenes and to add detailing to the images. They can effortlessly transform your bland and colorless images into realistic virtual environments. It indicates the contrast between dark and light spots of a frame and capable of fixing contrast ratios for vivid images.

Rating: 4.5/5

Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.
