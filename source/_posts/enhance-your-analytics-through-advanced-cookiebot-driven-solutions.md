ABBYY launched its new global partner program, [ABBYYOne](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), to enable partners to accelerate Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) throughout the enterprise. IPA is a market category that research firm IDC estimates will grow an average of 20.1% over the next few years to reach $42.4 billion by 2025.\[1\] It converges artificial intelligence (AI) with automation to give enterprise leaders more control over business operations, and simpler ways to automate and improve processes and decision making. To help organizations navigate their intelligent automation journey, ABBYYOne connects the most diverse ecosystem of partners across the globe with ABBYY’s industry-leading [Intelligent Document Processing](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) (IDP) and [Process Intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) solutions.
