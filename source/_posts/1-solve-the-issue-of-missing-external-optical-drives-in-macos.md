### 3\. Reset the SMC of your Mac

In many cases, the external DVD player is not showing up or not recognized by Mac because it doesn't get enough power. So you're suggested to reset the SMC of the Mac. Resetting the SMC can solve various power/battery related issues and other common problems. Before you start, disconnect the external DVD drive and any other non-essential devices.

**If your Mac has a removable battery:**

1. Shut down your Mac and disconnect it from all sources of power, including the battery.
2. Hold the power button for 5 seconds.
3. Reconnect your Mac to the power source and put the battery back in.
4. Turn the Mac back on.

**If your Mac has an unremovable battery:**

1. Shut down your Mac and disconnect it from the charger.
2. Hold Shift + Control + Option + Power button for 10 seconds.
3. Release the keys and reconnect the Mac with the power source.
4. Turn the Mac back on.

### 4\. Remove the DVD protections

Commercial DVDs are encoded with various copy protections like the region code. The Mac external DVD players from LG, Samsung, Asus, Dell, etc. are normally limited to 5 times of DVD region code changes. After 5 it's locked to the last region you set. For this reason, you may find some DVDs are not recognized by the external Mac DVD player. To get your external DVD player work on Mac, you can either:

* Try the VLC player. It ignores region setting and doesn't mess with the DVD hardware's limit of 5 resets.
* Try to remove the region code and other DVD protections using a DVD ripper like [**MacX DVD Ripper Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It will bypass region code, RCE, bad sector, RPC, etc. and convert DVDs to MP4, HEVC, h.264, MOV, M4V, MPEG, and more for Mac.

### 5\. Try another adapter

Now you can't plug an external DVD player directly into the Mac as it now has the new Thunderbolt port. Instead, you need an adapter to connect the drive and the Mac. Therefore, that may cause the external DVD player not working on Mac problems. First, if the Apple USB SuperDrive is too old, it may not getting enough power from the USB port on modern Macs. Second, if your USB adopter is bus powered, you'd better try a self-powered adapter.

### 6\. Remove any virtual machine software 

Virtual machines help users to run other systems such as Windows and Linux on Mac. So Mac users can use Windows apps on Mac without the need to perchase another PC. However, the virtual machine software can sometimes cause conflict with physical optical drive. If your external CD/DVD drive is not working on your Mac and you happen to have a virtual machine app on the computer, consider to remove the software.

### 7\. Check System Information 

Go to "Apple menu" > "About This Mac" > "System Report." Under "Hardware" in the left sidebar, click "USB" (or "Thunderbolt" if you're using a Thunderbolt connection). Look for your external DVD drive in the list of connected devices. If it's not listed, there may be a hardware issue or connection problem.

### 8\. Check for Software Conflicts 

Sometimes, third-party software or drivers can interfere with the operation of external DVD drives. Try restarting your Mac in Safe Mode (hold down the Shift key during startup) to see if the issue persists. If it works in Safe Mode, you may need to identify and uninstall problematic software.

### Final Words

If you've tried all of these troubleshooting steps and your external CD/DVD drive is still not working, it's possible there's a hardware issue with the drive itself or the connection port on your Mac. In this case, it's recommended to consult Apple Support or a certified technician for further diagnosis and repair options.
