## Unleash Creativity: Design Your Own Logos Using Template Assets (Free)

A logo represents your brand and gives the audience a sense of identity; brand identity is a key factor in brand building and growth. For example, the main difference between cloth vendors/manufacturers is brand identity. In a simple term, “what makes your brand different from the competitors?” – your logo is one of the answers. **Free logo templates** are easy to use, customizable, and applicable for brand promotion and recognition. Although most **logo templates** are customizable, some are not editable. This article talks about editable and not editable free logo templates. Learn more below.

## Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)

Editable logo templates differ from other templates because they support modification and diversification. Customizing a template gives total access and quality creation in your care. In short, if it is editable, you remove, add, and save a modified version of a logo template. All logo makers are not free or easy to edit; however, some editable free logo templates include:

1. [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/create/logos/)

Canva is an essential logo template maker. You can do more with the editable logo template creator because it contains several collections of logo templates that serve as the basis for your logo creation. You may not necessarily subscribe to the premium package if you do not need the premium files. You can learn more about Canva, especially how to create logo templates, from the official website.

The website gives full access to all users, educating them on how to use the Canva tool for better logo making. Canva AI algorithm suggests designs based on your history. For example, you locate resourceful raw collections for projects without much stress. The beautiful algorithm feature is important if you create more than one logo.

The Canva (free) feature includes free download (limited resolution), limited editing tools, and unlimited space work. You must create an account before accessing the official website editing tool since the software does not require an editor to make changes or customize a template.

1. **Adobe**

Adobe has software for logo making and design; however, [Adobe Create Logo Maker](https://express.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/), an official website option, allows direct free logo making. You need not download or install the software before using Adobe Create from the page. Adobe has outstanding features that put it above the competition: vector graphics, scaling, and quality maintenance.

All designs come from a basic idea; with Adobe, you can amplify your idea into a captivating logo – this is possible with the vector graphics. Logos are naturally simple and small; however, if you need a high print logo for your company, especially a 3D inscription, you may need Adobe vector graphics. The vector graphics put you at a high resolution to size ratio: maintaining a quality resolution irrespective of the log size.
