## Part 1: Can I Make an NFT?

NFT can be defined as a unique digital token. It is designed on the blockchain concept that makes it similar to crypto currency. However, unlike crypto currencies that act as digital currencies for transactions, NFTs are tokens that are linked to artwork in the digital world. They add uniqueness and authenticity to digital artwork or similar products. As it is based on blockchain technology, NFTs help make digital artwork difficult to forge.

In most cases NFTs cost money. However, there are some creator applications, offline as well as online, that can help users create NFTs without having to pay for them initially. The low entry barrier is possible with a new business model. These are many platforms that allow people to create NFTs for their assets for free. These are billed only when their digital assets are actually sold. So there is no cost upfront that users need to pay. Only when their NFTs are being purchased, the cost is deducted from the sale price.
