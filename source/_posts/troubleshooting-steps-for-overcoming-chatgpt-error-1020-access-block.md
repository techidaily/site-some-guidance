 Trying to [talk to ChatGPT](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capture-clarity-editing-insights-for-professional-results/) only to be welcomed by the "Error Code 1020 Access Denied" error? If so, you may not have permission to access the site. You can apply a few fixes to resolve the problem and get talking with ChatGPT again. Here's how.

##  What Is ChatGPT's "Error 1020 Access Denied" Issue?

[ChatGPT](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-how-to-find-free-sites-for-sound-effect-and-add-them-in-final-cut-pro-for-2024/) displays an "[Error 1020: Access Denied](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)" message when you don't have permission to access the site. OpenAI may have blocked your [IP address](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fake-the-location-to-get-around-the-mlb-blackouts-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) (the code used to identify your device on the internet) or your login session from further using the site. The website owner may have done this on suspicion you're abusing ChatGPT. You can still get the error even if you aren't going against OpenAI's terms of use, thanks to a faulty web browser, a blocked VPN, or an interfering web browser extension.

##  How to Fix an Error Code 1020 Access Denied on ChatGPT

 Depending on the exact cause of the problem, there are multiple ways you can get around a 1020 error code on OpenAI's website.

###  Enable or Disable Your VPN

 Since the most common reason you can't access ChatGPT is that the site has blocked your IP address, change your IP address, and your issue will be fixed.

 If you don't already [use a VPN](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-ffmpeg-audioscape-maintaining-original-audio-formats/), get one and use it to pretend to be from another location. Using a VPN is one of the simplest [ways to change your IP address](https://win-able.techidaily.com/resolving-chrome-and-firefox-glitch-uninterrupted-audio-with-youtube-videos/), allowing you to bypass any IP-related restrictions.

 If you're already using a VPN, [ChatGPT may have blocked your VPN's IP address](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-regulations-on-capturing-youtube-playbacks/). In this case, turn off your VPN service and see if the site loads.

###  Turn Off Your Web Browser Extensions

 Your web browser's extensions may be interfering with ChatGPT's functionalities, causing the site to deny your access and display an error message.

 In this case, verify if the extensions are the culprit by opening the ChatGPT site [in an incognito window in your Chrome](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-pinnacle-5-frame-timelapse-recorder-for-2024/), [Firefox](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-proven-ways-to-unlock-oneplus-12r-phone-when-you-forget-the-password-by-drfone-android/), [Edge](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-from-your-apple-iphone-11-by-drfone-ios/), or [Safari](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-hack-filmora-coupon-codes-without-reddit/) web browser. If the site loads just fine in incognito, one or more of your browser extensions are likely the culprit.

 In that case, [disable all extensions in your Chrome](https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/easy-instructions-for-performing-a-successful-chromecast-update/), [Firefox](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), [Edge](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-bringing-text-to-life-3d-creation-in-photo/), or [Safari](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/nikons-sb-700-flash-balancing-cost-and-efficiency/) web browser. Then, enable one extension at a time to find the culprit. Once you've found the problematic add-in, remove it from your web browser, and your issue will be resolved.

###  Clear ChatGPT's Cookies in Your Web Browser

 ChatGPT's saved cookies in your web browser may be causing the issue, leading the site to display an error code 1020.

 In this case, clear the cookies in your [Chrome](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-take-control-of-time-top-10-free-video-speed-manipulation-apps-for-mobile/), [Firefox](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/download-the-latest-validity-fingerprint-sensor-driver-fast-and-simple-installation/), [Edge](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-future-of-home-entertainment-tv-or-projection-for-4k-in-2024/), and [Safari](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-edge-it-all-out-the-finest-frame-options-for-social-media-photography/) web browsers. Then, reopen your web browser and launch the ChatGPT site.

###  Use Another Web Browser

 If your issue persists, try [using another web browser](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/1722978947013-get-the-latest-intel-hd-graphics-4400-drivers-download-now/) on your computer or phone to access ChatGPT. This helps verify if the issue is with your current web browser.

 You can launch another web browser, say Firefox, and visit [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/). If the site loads, your previous browser had a problem. In this case, you can reset your [Chrome](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-nubia-z50s-pro-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [Firefox](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-the-two-factor-authentication-from-apple-iphone-6-plus-by-drfone-ios/), or [Edge](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/conquer-the-art-of-quick-messages-using-your-ipad/) browser to potentially fix your problem.

###  Use Another Internet Connection

 If you continue to see an "Error 1020 Access Denied" message on ChatGPT, switch to a different internet connection and see if the error is gone.

 You can [connect your computer to another Wi-Fi network](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-explore-free-options-10-leading-mac-artists-preferences/) and then try to access the ChatGPT site. If you don't have access to an extra wireless network, feel free to [use your iPhone](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlock-full-potential-of-obs-studio-for-android-devices/) or [Android phone's hotspot function](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/a-filmmakers-approach-to-classroom-instructional-videos-for-2024/).
