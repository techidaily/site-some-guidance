## Part 1\. 8 Popular Text Title Effects Types in AE

There are certain properties and parameters associated with text effects and animations in After Effects. You need to get a complete overview of these types so that you can adjust them and come up with stunning text animations in After Effects.

### 1\. 3D Text

Generally, when you type a text in After Effects, by default, it comes out to be two-dimensional. All the associated properties have X and Y axis only. However, if you are planning to create 3D text and title, you need to have Z axis.

After Effects has “Enable per-character 3D” property to all Z axis to applicable properties so that you can get the desired effect. You can go to properties like rotation or position to find Z axis that you can modify and get the perfect 3D text.

### 2\. Rotation and Anchor Point

Rotation is one of the most commonly used parameters in text animations. There are unlimited variations of text animations and effects that you can create using rotation parameter in After Effects. The rotation takes place in proportion to the anchor points of the text. When you change the value of Rotation parameter, the actual rotation takes place around the anchor points.

### 3\. Scale and Position

If you want to zoom in and zoom out animation for your text or title, you can use the Scale property in After Effects. You can use keyframes and for each keyframe, you can adjust the scale value and create an illustration of zooming in and out very easily.

There are different variations of zoom in and out effect that you can try on your text and title to make animation creative and visually appealing. On the other hand, position refers to the location of the text on the video frame depending on X, Y, and Z axis values.

### 4\. Blur and Opacity

You must have seen the text animation where the blurry text comes into focus and this can be achieved using Blur parameter. Many people confused Blur with Opacity but blur refers to out of focus while opacity can be understood by fade in and fade out effect. You can adjust the horizontal and vertical blur amount separately and you can come up with stunning text animations by changing Blur value.

### 5\. Fill and Stroke

When it comes to text formatting in animation, fill color and stroke color play a major role. You can change the fill of the text so that the text animation is about changing color randomly. There are different options available for fill color such as RGB, Hue, Saturation, and likewise.

Similarly, the stroke color can be changed and you can create an animation with changing outline color. At the same time, you can adjust the stroke width to make the text look thick or thin as per your animation requirements.

### 6\. Skew

If you want your text to be distorted and unusual, the skew parameter is there for you in After Effects. Skew means the character will not stay parallel and at right angles. You can adjust the skew value make texts distorted and this is useful in several text animations where distorted texts become normal texts. You can also skew texts in respect to different axis for creative animation.

### 7\. Tracking

Tracking refers to the spacing between the characters in a word for a text. You must have seen so many different types of text animations where the spacing between the characters is changing. You can create amazing funny and eye-catching text effects in After Effects by combining tracking and keyframe properly. Along with tracking, there is line anchor that determines the alignment of tracking. Similarly, there is line spacing parameter that controls the spacing between the lines.

### 8\. Keyframe

Keyframe is like stretching two points into multiple points and for every point, you can change the value of the different parameters we have mentioned. When different keyframes have different parameters, the text will automatically animate once you play the video.

Therefore, keyframes are the building blocks for text animations and you have to use keyframes to create all the different online text effects. You can put the keyframes far apart or close and speed up or slow down the animation.
