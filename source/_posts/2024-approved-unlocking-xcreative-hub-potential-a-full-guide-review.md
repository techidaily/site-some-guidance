### Download

**X video editor app OS** is specifically designed for Android devices.

You can also [download](https://ccm.net/downloads/internet/8967-xvideostudio-video-editor-for-android-apk/#download-xvideostudio-video-editor-windows) and use X on your PC. But since it is an Android app, you will need an emulator such as BlueStack to use the app.

### Price

X is available for free to use and does not require any subscription.
