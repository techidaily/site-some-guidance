**Best Export Quality:**

Using KineMaster, you can export your videos in almost all the resolutions you want. Like QHD, FHD, HD, or SD, even if you are using its free version, which most mobile video editing applications do not allow in their free versions.

### **Disadvantages:**

## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.
