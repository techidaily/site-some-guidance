## Tuning Into iPhone's Sound Scenarios

Continue reading this article until the end for more information about choosing the best podcasting app for your iPhone and also how to start a podcast on Spotify. Let's get started with a guide on searching, downloading, and listening to podcasts on iPhone.

## How To Find, Listen to and Download Podcasts on the iPhone?

While podcasts are an excellent method to learn about topics that interest you, data show that 48% of people who don't listen to podcasts don't know how to. We've assembled a guide to help you search, listen to, and download podcasts on your iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the Apple Podcasts app. Download it if you don't already have it. After launching the application, look for the "Browse" button on the toolbar at the bottom. You may find out what's hot or featured across several categories. Another option to find a podcast is to type its name into the "search" section.

When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details. A summary of the podcast's topic, ratings, genre, and other information is included in the additional details. The most recent episode of that podcast should be the one that appears at the top. Earlier episodes can be listened to by scrolling down and selecting the one you want to hear.

You can choose to subscribe or unfollow the podcast you're listening to. By subscribing to a podcast, you can stay updated on new content and forthcoming episodes.

## Why Can't I Play a Podcast on My iPhone?

If your iPhone is not playing podcasts, there's usually a problem with downloading or syncing the podcast with other devices.

2. Relaunch the Apple Podcasts app. You can swipe up and close an app while multitasking on an iPhone or iPad. Mac users can quit the application by right-clicking on the dock icon and choosing Quit. When you reopen the app, try hearing the podcast once more.
3. Ensure the appropriate audio output is chosen.
4. Redownload the podcast after erasing it from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. When downloaded, files can sometimes become corrupt.
5. Verify the quality of your Wi-Fi or cellular data connection.
6. Restart your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Giving your device a new start may resolve a persistent glitch or connection issue.
