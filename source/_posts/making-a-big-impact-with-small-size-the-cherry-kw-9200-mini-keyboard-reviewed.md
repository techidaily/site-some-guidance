##  Build and Design: Size Isn't Everything

![Person holding the Cherry KW 9200 Mini Keyboard](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/person-holding-the-cherry-kw-9200-mini-keyboard-3jpg_52759650297_o.jpg)

 Taking the KW 9200 MINI out of its box the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by its compact size. With a footprint of about 12x5 inches, this keyboard is sleek and compact, rivaling the size of a standard keyboard found on 15.6-inch laptops. It's incredibly easy to carry, slipping snugly into any laptop backpack without taking up much space. Inside the box, you also find a high-quality travel pouch and a reasonably long USB type-A to type-C cable. This cable can be used to recharge the keyboard battery for wireless usage or to use the keyboard directly in wired mode.

 The keyboard's build quality feels premium, with a matte black plastic chassis that feels solid and well-constructed. The plate underneath the keys is painted a bright and bold red color, which almost convinced me that the keys were backlit. Although they're not, I'm still smitten with the tasteful black-and-red color scheme. Weighing just about a pound, the keyboard does feel deceptively hefty for its compact size. While it's not heavy, per se, the added heft certainly contributes to the overall sense of high-quality construction.

 The absence of a palm rest may be a deal-breaker for some, but the KW 9200 MINI's focus on compact size and portability makes this omission understandable. It features a slight tilt by default, but I found that folding out the adjustable feet for a more tilted typing position was ideal for optimal comfort. On the keyboard's top edge, you'll find the red-colored USB dongle tucked in nicely, along with the USB type-C port, a battery level indicator LED, and the power on/off slider.

 Overall, the Cherry KW9200 MINI has a sleek and minimalist design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

##  Setup and Software: Simplicity at Its Best

 Setting up the KW 9200 MINI was easier than I expected. I plugged in the included USB cable to charge the keyboard via my PC's USB port, and the keyboard was already ready to use in wired mode. I removed the cable after the battery LED turned off, indicating a full charge, and plugged in the USB dongle, making the keyboard instantly pair with my PC wirelessly.

 You can further connect the keyboard to up to two more devices via Bluetooth. Switching between the devices is a breeze thanks to the F1-F4 function keys, which allow for effortless hot-swapping between connected devices. The keyboard works perfectly well with Windows and Android machines. You can also connect it to Macs, but you get limited functionality. If you want a wireless keyboard for your Mac, consider the [Logitech MX Keys Mini](https://www.reviewgeek.com/118706/logitech-mx-mechanical-mini-keyboard-review-compact-and-premium/).

 Cherry also offers its [Cherry Keys software](https://www.cherry-world.com/service/software/keys) (available only for Windows) for customizing your keyboard experience. The KW 9200 MINI offers the ability to program each of its 12 function keys to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic media control and page scrolling to more advanced functions such as app launching and text block insertion, all at the simple press of a button.

 According to Cherry's official website, the keyboard battery can last for weeks, and I can confirm that this claim is valid. As of writing this review, I have been using the keyboard for approximately two weeks without the need for a recharge since the initial setup. The keyboard does enter a low-power state when not being used, although you can just turn it off between uses.

 However, it's worth noting that there's no accurate way of determining the battery's exact level, and the only indication provided is a flashing LED that signals the need for a recharge.

##  Typing and Usage Experience: Exceeds Expectations

![Person typing on the Cherry KW 9200 Mini Keyboard](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/person-typing-on-the-cherry-kw-9200-mini-keyboardjpg_52759651092_o.jpg)

 The keyboard boasts scissor-switch keys using the Cherry SX scissor mechanism, known for its flat keys and precise typing feel. Despite being a compact keyboard, the Cherry KW 9200 MINI maintains the familiar layout of a full-size keyboard. The only differences are the missing numeric keypad and the relocated arrow keys, now at the keyboard's bottom right. The FN key is fully utilized, allowing you to access typical features like Page Up/Down, Print Screen, Volume controls, and even multimedia playback without needing dedicated keys. Super effective.

 Coming from a [split ergonomic keyboard](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/auroras-dynamic-range-feature-a-detailed-perspective/), I had to go through a slight learning curve adjusting to the KW 9200 MINI's form factor, but I achieved my usual typing speed within a couple of hours. There is a decent amount of key travel, making the keyboard feel much more tactile than laptop keyboards or cheaper BT keyboards. However, mechanical keyboard enthusiasts might not like the low-profile keys and near-silent typing experience.

 Although it is not explicitly marketed as a [gaming keyboard](https://win11.techidaily.com/essential-tips-for-lowering-wlanext-cpu-usage/), I found it sufficiently responsive for playing FIFA on my PC. I didn't face problems with the keyboard registering multiple keys simultaneously, and there was no perceivable input lag either. While the 9200 MINI lacks backlit keys and could benefit from a more ergonomic typing position, it's important to remember that this keyboard was not designed to be a permanent fixture on a desk. It's designed to be conveniently transported, so you can easily take it out during a flight, while in a cab, or sitting in a cafe, connect it to your laptop or smartphone, and enjoy a seamless and efficient typing experience. And that, it does very well.

##  Should You Buy the Cherry KW 9200 MINI Keyboard?

 Without a doubt, the [Cherry KW 9200 MINI keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXBC95X5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228098&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fcherry-kw-9200-mini-keyboard-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is an exceptional option for anyone seeking a high-quality wireless keyboard that boasts both portability and functionality. Its compact and sleek design makes it the perfect companion for those who frequently travel with their devices, while the Cherry SX switches provide unparalleled tactile feedback, making it an excellent choice for both typing and gaming.

 Additionally, the keyboard's intuitive features, such as customizable shortcuts and the ability to access common functionalities via the FN key, elevate its convenience factor. However, it's worth noting that the lack of backlit keys may pose an inconvenience for users who work in dimly lit environments, and the [absence of a number pad](https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-create-cartoons-like-a-pro-top-10-tools-for-beginners/) may be a deal-breaker for some who rely on it for their work. Its incompatibility with Macs is another thing to remember.

 Despite these downsides, this is still a high-quality keyboard with an impressive typing experience. If you're just looking for a portable Bluetooth keyboard for occasional usage, you can get much cheaper alternatives like the [Logitech K380](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Easy-Switch-Battery-PC/dp/B0B8M5FBFQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228098&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fcherry-kw-9200-mini-keyboard-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). If you're willing to spend on a nice keyboard, you can find options like the [Logitech MX Mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Illuminated-Performance-Bluetooth/dp/B09LK73VHG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228098&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fcherry-kw-9200-mini-keyboard-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which offers backlit keys and compatibility with Macs. Nonetheless, if you're seeking a wireless keyboard that seamlessly combines portability, comfort, and features, the Cherry KW 9200 MINI is undoubtedly worth your consideration.
