## Top Solutions to Correct Audio Drift & AV Desync iMovie Issue

* [Solution 1\. Change Audio Sampling Rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [Solution 2\. Convert Variable Frame Rate to Constant Frame Rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [Solution 3\. Trim Audio Clip within iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [Solution 4\. Change Speed using iMovie Speed Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [Solution 5\. Re-make Sound Track for Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

##  Solution 1\. Change Audio Sampling Rate

Sampling rate matters a lot in audio track. Generally, the sampling rate of your original audio track won't get changed within iMovie. But that's not the case when iMovie exports your video footage. It might automatically mess up your audio sampling rate. That would result in video audio desync error after iMovie exporting. 

To make it right, you just need to resample your audio track. Load your iMovie exports to freeware VLC player and resample your sound track. Change the exports audio sampling rate to 48 KHz if it's 44.1 KHz. Afterwards, load it to iMovie and export from iMovie to test if it's fixed.

## Solution 2\. Convert Variable Frame Rate to Constant Frame Rate

The frame rate of your video is another major cause to induce this trouble. Especially, if you shoot on an iPhone of any sort, you'll get a video file at a variable frame rate. Notwithstanding you might select 24, 30 or 60 FPS, it won't go that way during shooting. Nor will it stay during iMovie editing.

 Well it happens that the variable frame rate will be pretty close to constant FPS sometimes. Yet, luck won't last forever. Most time, the variable frame rate will vary extensively, resulting in audio out of sync with video after iMovie exporting. In such case, you need to use a frame rate converter to change variable frame rate to constant frame rate.

## Solution 3\. Trim Audio Clip within iMovie

Some cases, if not all, would be video and audio tracks detached at the first place and then be merged later. Mostly, those video tracks and audio tracks originate from different device. All these factors together would jointly increase the chance of video audio desync error after iMovie editing and exporting. The issue can be fixable by extracting the audio from the project and re-adding it. To do so, 5 steps are inevitable.

**Step 1:** Launch iMovie on your Mac via Applications under Finder.

**Step 2:** Tap "File" > "Import Movies" > load your desired video footage > tap "Choose."

**Step 3:** Pitch on the iMovie file > select "Advanced" on the iMovie menu > opt for "Detach Audio" (in some versions of iMovie, it's named as "Extract Audio").

Detach audio from video in iMovie

**Step 4:** Choose the audio file > hit "Edit" > "Trim to Selection" and trim the audio duration to sync up to the video clip.

**Step 5:** Choose "File" and click "Save" to re-combine video and audio tracks together.

## Solution 4\. Change Speed using iMovie Speed Editor

Audio matched with video at the start of a project gradually de-syncs, becoming apparent after a couple of minutes. And in case, unfortunately, the above workarounds don't help you out of this iMovie A/V desync trouble, try to change speed using iMovie speed editor. 

1. Play your video file in iMovie and remember the specific timing that the video and audio begin to desync.
2. Watch the whole video and likewise remember the specific timing that the A/V desync stops.
3. Place two key frames on these two timings (desync start & end timing).
4. Opt for the audio drifting part > right click on this video track and tap "Show Speed Editor" (shortcut is to type cmd-R).
5. Change "Normal" to "Custom" under Speed category.

6. Change the percentage (next to Speed) from 100% to 101%.

7. Drag the audio timeline back until they sync at the end, and double check the beginning.

If the text guide is tedious to you, follow the guide with video tutorial: 

## Solution 5\. Re-make Sound Track for Video

Give up your video if the audio and video are severely out of sync. Instead, re-make your sound track for your video and re-add it to video track after it's finished. As for those movies or TV shows downloaded from online sites, you can re-download audio track files from online sites after detaching the incorrect one from video.
