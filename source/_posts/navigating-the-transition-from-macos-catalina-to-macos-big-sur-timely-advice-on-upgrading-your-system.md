## 1\. Push ARM Transition

Along with macOS 11 upgrade is the [Intel x86 to ARM transition](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) in Macs. Therefore, MacOS Big Sur can help push the transition instead of just an incremental improvement over Catalina. Compared to macOS 10.15, Big Sur has built in a range of technologies to make the ARM transition less painful. For example, with the emulator Rosetta 2, Intel x86 apps can be translated to commands for Apple silicon to enable ARM Macs run old Intel apps. And the Universal 2 binary is able to make apps run on both the existing Intel Macs and ARM Macs. 

The ARM transition will deliver faster performance, longer battery life, and innovative techs. It is predicated that ARM can boost Mac performance by 50%. All this requires optimized software and apps. That's why it's necessary to [upgrade Catilina to macOS Big Sur](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

## 2\. New Design

Compared to Big Sur, macOS 10.15 Catalina looks a little dated. That's because the new system has introduced an entirely new design, also the biggest design upgrade since Mac OS X. Everything is refined from the curvature of window corners to colors and dock icon designs. For example, the icons in the Dock are redesigned with a more uniform squircle shape; buttons and controls for apps will appear when needed and disappear then not in use; the menu bar is translucent now with a new Control Center to offer access to more controls…
