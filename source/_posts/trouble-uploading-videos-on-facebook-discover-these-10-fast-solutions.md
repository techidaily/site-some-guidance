## How to Fix Facebook Not Uploading Video Issue

Now, let's try each resolution in order until we fix it. 

### Fix 1\. Check Facebook status

You can go to Downdetector or another similar website to see if there are Facebook outages reported. If there are, it means that Facebook video not uploading issue is possibly a problem with Facebook server. In this case, you need to wait for Facebook to be restored and try uploading video on Facebook again.

### Fix 2\. Check Your Video Specs

In most cases, video won't be posted to Facebook because of incompatibility issue. To be specific, [Facebook has strict requirements on the file format](https://www.facebook.com/help/218673814818907), file size, and length of the video you are trying to upload. So, to post a video on Facebook successfully and smoothly, you have to first of all make sure that the video you are trying to post meets Facebook's requirements. The Facebook accepted standards are below. Check if your video is qualified or not.

**Accepted Video Formats**

MPEG-4 (.mp4, .m4v. mpeg4), MPEG (.mpe, .mpg, .mpeg, .dat), FLV (.flv, .f4v), AVI (.avi), WMV (.wmv), 3GP (.3gp, .3g2, .3gpp), MKV (.mkv), AVCHD (.m2ts/.mts), MOD (.mod), QuickTime video (.mov), DVD video (.vob), TOD (.tod), DIVX (.divx), DV video, OGG (.ogm, .ogv), MPEG Transport Stream (.ts), Nullsoft Video (nsv)

[Best video format for Facebook](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/): **MP4** (codec: H.264), for MP4 keeps a good balance between video quality and file size, suitable for FaceBook HD video footages publishing with a little bit longer video. To convert your video to MP4 file format, please resort to a solid [MP4 video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**Video Size Requirement for Facebook Sharinging**

 The maximum size of all the videos posted to Facebook shall be **no greater than 1.75GB**. No minimum video size is applied. And if your video file is seemingly larger than what you want, you can apply a reliable video compression software to compress and shrink video file size without lossing any video quality. 

**Video Length** 

 The common standard video longer than **20 minutes** in length will get the FB upload error message. As for 360 4K VR video upload to Facebook, your video length should be maintained 6 mins or shorter.

**Aspect Ratio**

Aspect ratio, also called dimension, refers to the width and height of the video screen. The dimensions of the Facebook video shall be between 9×16 and 16×9\.
