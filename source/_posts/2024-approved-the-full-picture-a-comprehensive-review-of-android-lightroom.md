## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages Of Lightroom App For Android

The Lightroom app for Android has a variety of features that can be useful for both amateur and professional photographers. However, the app also has drawbacks that you should be aware of before you download it.

Moreover, an Auto (preset color correction) tool is also added, which can help you fix your picture automatically.

The Lightroom app offers cloud support and a picture library that keeps your data in sync between your devices to help you access it anywhere, anytime. The app also provides an extensive export feature that allows you to set file type, quality, and dimension before saving the picture on your device.

**Disadvantages:** Lightroom does not support printing or plugins. You can't print your photos directly from the app, nor can you use plugins to add extra features. The app doesn't have layer-based editing. Therefore, you can't make complex edits to your photos on the go.

Furthermore, the sharing feature is limited and does not allow you to share your picture directly with the Adobe Discover photo-sharing community.
