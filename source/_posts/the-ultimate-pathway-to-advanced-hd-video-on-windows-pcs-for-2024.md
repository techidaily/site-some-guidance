## Part 1: What is Windows HD Color?

Windows HD Color is the feature that comes in the latest Windows 10 system that supports HDR content on the PC. The improved hardware will now let you enjoy the HDR content in a hassle-free manner.

With HDR content you get a wider range of colors as well as brightness that further helps in bringing out the details between the extremes. The traditional content which is also termed Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content majorly shows either the details of the bright part of the darker part but not both of them at a time. Contrary to this, the HDR content is capable of enhancing both the light as well as the dark scenes while preserving the details and producing the true colors.

For instance, in SDR content you would miss seeing the details of a building texture on a sunny day while in HDR content, you would not miss these details. So, it can be said that with HDR, the white will appear whiter and the black will appear blacker adding more depth and detail to the content.

## Part 2: How do I Watch HDR video in Windows?

To watch HDR content on your Windows system the PC, display, and all other connected devices need to be HDR compatible. Below we have listed the requirements for watching HDR content on a PC.

**HDR compatible Monitor or a TV**

The very first requirement for you to enjoy the HDR content is a compatible display device which can be a monitor or a connected TV. So, ensure that your device is Displayed 1000 or Display HDR1600 for the HDR content to play. The HDR10 displays will not work here as they are capable of only accepting the HDR signals but cannot produce HDR content.

![hdr compatible monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-6.jpg)

**Graphics Chip that is HDR capable**

An HDR-capable GPU will be required for communicating with the display. For quality content, it is recommended to use the higher-end cards that are capable of offering better output settings. You can use Nvidia GTX 950 or the later ones or AMDs Radeon R9 380 or the later ones. For the users having Intel graphics, go with the 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPU or the later versions.

**Good quality DisplayPort Cable or HDMI**

Though the present data HDMI cables are capable of carrying the 4K signals for HDR content to perform well we suggest using a Premium High Speed or 18Gbps one.

**HDR Contents**

## Part 5: Hot FAQs on Windows HD Color

Below listed are some of the commonly asked questions and their answers related to Windows HD color.

### 1\. How to fix the HDR option not available on Windows 10?

There are chances that when you try to enable the Windows HD Color settings on your Windows 10 system, the option appears to be grayed out or after connecting with an external HDR-capable monitor it is not available.

If the feature to enable the HDR in Windows HD Color Settings does not appear after being connected to an external HDR display then it means that the desktop is duplicated on both the screens by the Windows 10 system and this configuration is not supported. So, to play the HDR on your external monitor, follow the below-listed steps.

1. Open the Settings menu and choose System > Display.
2. Next, choose an external monitor from the Rearrange your displays section.
3. Choose Extend these displays option from the Multiple displays section.
4. Next, tap on the Windows HD Color Settings option and then finally toggle switch and turn on the Play HDR games and app option.
5. If the Stream HDR video toggle switch is applicable, you can turn it on too.

In case the HDR option on your Windows 10 system is grayed out then it means that the power default settings of the system are disabling the option when it runs on battery. To overcome this problem, you would need to connect your laptop to the power source or you can also change the settings and allow to play the HDR settings while the system runs on battery.

### 2\. Why is HDR washed out on an external monitor?

At times, you may experience HDR washed out on an external monitor. This may happen when the external monitor that you have used is not HDR compatible. The external monitor should be Displayed certified and support HDR 1000 or HDR 1600 along with DisplayPort 1.4 or HDMI 2.0 to play your HDR content in high quality.

Though there might be other reasons for washed-out HDR as well like HDR feature not turned on, brightness balance not having proper settings, and others.
