## Launch Announcement: Unveiling of the New Google Pixel Phone on August 13Th

We're already in the second half of the year, which means we're about to see a new batch of smartphones land on the market. Some people are awaiting iPhones while others want to see what Samsung has in store, but Google is also set to release its newest generation of Pixel phones. Now, we know when they will be announced.

 Google has started sending out invites to the press for a "Made by Google" event to be held on August 13th. The company is hinting that we'll see new announcements related to AI, Android software, and, of course, hardware. Made by Google events always mostly revolve around new hardware launches—not only smartphones, but occasionally also new tablets, smart home hardware, earbuds, smartwatches, or laptops, so it'll be interesting to see what Google has in store for us this year.

 One thing we'll see for certain is the announcement of the Pixel 9 series. Google also dropped a teaser through its social media accounts showing the silhouette of a smartphone as well as the same August 13th date in Roman numerals.

 Both the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro have leaked in previous months, and we should get a tweaked design as well as upgraded internals. Then again, nothing is actually official until Google representatives get on a stage and shows us.

 As for things that we'll likely see, we'll probably get a new [Tensor SoC](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), upgraded cameras, and a ton of AI features—Google has always tied the term "AI" to Pixels even before the age of generative AI was ushered in, such as with its many camera optimizations, so it wouldn't be surprising to see Google actually go all-in here now that it has Gemini. The phones will also most certainly run [Android 15](https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-top-notch-internet-speed-and-value-with-the-tp-link-archer-a6-rigorous-review-of-an-ac12/) out of the box, which is currently in a beta testing stage.

 It's also curious to see that Google might actually announce these phones way earlier than usual. The [Pixel 8](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-take-your-teamsnap-game-to-the-next-level-expert-tips/) was announced in October last year. If you ask us, this is probably a move to avoid clashing with the iPhone's launch, which always happens in September and probably subtracts a lot of potential sales from Google directly or indirectly.
