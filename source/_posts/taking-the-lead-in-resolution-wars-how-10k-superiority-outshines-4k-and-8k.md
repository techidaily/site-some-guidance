Compare 8k with Ultra HD 4K, 8K is taken as Full Ultra HD boasting a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels. While much higher than 4K and 8K, 10K QUHD is a display resolution of 15360 x8640 pixels. The QUHD is 4 times as many pixels as 8K FUHD. So is between 8K and 4K or between [4K and 1080p full HD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

**• What Is 10K Resolution, 4K or 8K Resolution:** 4k resolution refers to a display with horizontal resolution of 4000 pixels. Compare 4K and 10K, 8K measures a horizontal resolution of 8000 pixels. While 10k is a successor to 8K and 4K resolutions and is supposed to the highest UHDTV resolution so far. Slightly lower than 16K 10K has a staggering 10328 x7760 resolution. To be Exact, 10K is 1.25 times of 8k resolution, 2.5 times of 4K resolution and 10 times of the resolution of Full HD. 

![Frame Rate](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/frame-rate.jpg) 

**• Frame Rate**: 4K has a frame rate of 60fps like [iPhone X/8/8 Plus recorded 4K video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) while 8K is faster than 4K with frame rate at 120fps. Despite Rec.2020 doesn't show for 10K frame rate, 10k will be undoubtedly more than 120fps, compared to 4K and 8K. 

![Viewing Distance and Angle](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/viewing-distance.jpg) 

**• Viewing Distance and Angle**: Tests show that 4k resolution isn't fully apparent until you sit as close as 3.6 feet for a 55-inch screen. But if you are monitoring 8k content, a 65" screen is the best. Please watch from 3 feet away, which leads to a viewing angle of 160o. Right now, there are not any info about the viewing distance for 10K. But we will keep it updated.

![Color Depth](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/color-depth.jpg) 

**• Color Depth**: The 4K UHD has color depth of 10-bits or 12-bits while 8K at 48-bit video. And we stay optimistic to 10K, though the exact color depth of 10K is still unknown. We will instantly update 10k color depth once the information leaks.

![TV monitor](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/monitor.jpg) 

**• Best 4K/8K/10K TVs and Monitors:** One year ago Sharp broken the perceive that 4K is the ultimate LCD TV resolution. But a 82" 10k display at 10240x4320 resolution revealed in SID Disney Technology Week 2015 proves such TV offers better image quality. Insider said common users wouldn't differentiate 4K and 8K, except those applying professional detector. So similar to 8K TV, 10K is still undistinguishable by the naked eye. 

In a sense, 4K monitor is estimated to reach peak in 2024\. While 8K, rather than 10K, is the final 2D TV format and still needs over 20 years for its popularization. But we still stay optimistic to the 8K and 10K monitors in the future as this is an inevitable trend, and the 10K monitor tech will be possibly applied to high-tech field in ecommerce or aerospace.

**How about 4K/8K/10K video player?** We can find few 10K video player yet and 8K video player is still on the way, but there're some [4K video players](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that are able to play 4K & 8K videos without any hassle.
