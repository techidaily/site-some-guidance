##  Can You Keep Downloads Running While Windows Is in Sleep Mode?

 The answer to that question is no. If you [put your Windows system in sleep mode](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/speak-up-discover-how-openai-revolutionizes-chatbot-experience-with-voice-recognition-in-chatgpt/) (even by closing your laptop's lid), you can't keep downloads running. This is because when your system enters sleep mode, it disables your disk, causing your file downloads not to progress.

##  How to Keep Downloads Running While Your Laptop's Lid Is Closed

 By default, when you close your laptop’s lid, your Windows 11 or Windows 10 system enters sleep mode. This causes your downloads to get interrupted. To overcome this, you can [keep the laptop running with the lid closed](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-nutritional-meal-scheduling-with-ai-powered-chatgpt-guidance/).

 To make that change, first [launch Control Panel](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/seamless-media-exchange-transferring-facebook-content-to-whatsapp-for-2024/). Here, select "Hardware and Sound".

##  How to Turn Off Sleep Mode on Your Windows PC

 If you have a tower PC that automatically enters sleep mode and interrupts your file downloads, turn off the sleep mode feature.

 To do that on your Windows 11 or 10 PC, [open Control Panel](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/1722861107683-troubleshooting-when-your-iphone-doesnt-ring-easy-fixes-inside/) and navigate to Hardware and Sound > Power Options. In the left sidebar, select "Change When the Computer Sleeps".

!['Change When the Computer Sleeps' highlighted in Control Panel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/5-windows-sleep-settings.jpg) 

 On the following screen, in the "Put the Computer to Sleep" drop-down menus, select "Never" for both. Then, click "Save Changes".
