_I am looking for a way to upload videos to Instagram from desktop. Do you know any web apps that can do that?_

Since the release of Instagram V4.1, users finally get the ability to **upload video to Instagram** from iPhone that is recorded with the phone's camera. But as a mobile-exclusive app, Instagram provides no option for Instagram video post from computer/desktop. There are some their-party Instagram video uploaders and methods that help to post videos on Instagram via computer/laptop. Here we offer a detailed guide on how to put to Instgram from PC/Mac, YouTube, iPhone/Android in HD quality. 

## Part 1: Customize Video to Meet Instagram Upload Demands

If you want to post a video to Instagram from computer/phones without losing quality and aviod sharing being stuck or not working problem, you'd better choose the right settings for the videos that are to be uploaded to Instagram. Therefore, learn the Instagram limits on post videos in file size, length, resolutions, codec and other settings, together with a Instagram video uploader to help you on how to make your videos qualified for Instagram.

### A. Instagram video upload limits

Size: maximum width 1080 pixels (any height)

Frame Rate: 29.96 frames per second

Codec: H.264 codec / MP4

Bit rate: 3,500 kbps video bitrate<

Audio: AAC audio codec at 44.1 kHz mono

Length: 60 seconds

Filesize: 15MB

### B. How to make Instagram accepted videos/upload Instagram videos from YouTube/Websites

To post clips to Instagram from PC/Mac or iPhone/Android without losing quality, you are required to make sure that the output video files are in the limits above. However, some users are bothered by the large size of videos recorded with HD cameras or incompatible video formats. In those cases, you're suggested to convert/compress the Instagram publish videos first. Here we use [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

* Convert any video to [Instagram supported formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) MP4 (H264) from MKV, MOV, AVI, FLV, MTS, WMV and H265 (HEVC), MPEG-4, VP9, VP8, DivX, etc. codec.

## Part 2: How to post Video to Instagram from Windows/macOS

To post videos on Instagram from computer/desktop, there are mainly two ways to go: share videos to Instagram from computer with the use of mobile phones or share video on Instagram from computer directly with a third-party Instagram video uploader. (For those who want to download photos from Mac/PC to Instagram, there are also websites that may help like deskgram.com.)

### A. Ways to Sync Videos from Computer to Mobile Device 

The methods below involve the use of a smartphone, namely, after you edit the video with the Instagram video uploader mentioned in Section B, Part 1, you simply need to get the video from computer to smartphone and share video on Instagram from camera roll as usual. This is preferable for those who don't want to install any program. Below are a few workarounds to do it: 

![Upload video to Instagram from computer](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/instagram-upload-2.jpg) 

**1\. No.1 Fast Speed to Import videos from computer to iPhone iPad** 

After your video is ready, you can transfer the video to iPhone iPad from Mac/PC for Instagram posting. Instead of the complicated iTunes, the alternative [**MacX MediaTrans**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) does this job even better. It will help you easily transfer videos (any format) from computer to iPhone iPad using auto video conversion feature with only 3 clicks. Auto compress and reduce file size for you, too.

**2\. Send the video to yours via Email**

This is the most common way to sync computer videos to mobile device: email the video to your account, download the video from the email app on your iPhone/Android and then you can start to post video files to Instagram from the camera roll. The drawback lies in the file size that may be limited by the email.

**3\. Add videos to device via Dropbox or Google Drive** 

There are many similar service to send computer files to smartphones like AirDrop, but Google Drive and Dropbox are recommended as the best cloud ways to save the computer videos on smartphones. They are easy to use and will store photos, docs, files and videos. Note that with Google Drive, you can't save the videos in camera roll. But you can easily post videos on Instagram with Dropbox from the camera roll. 

**4\. Connect computer to smartphones for transfer**

The last way is simple and everyone will know. Connect your Android/iOS devices to your computer using the USB cable. Transfer the video you'd want to put to Instagram to the smartphones. Then share video on Instagram from camera roll in usual way.

After you use the above methods to sync videos to your mobile device, then you can open Instagram and post video to Instagram now.

### B. Publish video to Instagram from Computer via desktop application
