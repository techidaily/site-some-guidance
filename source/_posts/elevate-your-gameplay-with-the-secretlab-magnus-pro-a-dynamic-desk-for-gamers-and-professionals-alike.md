##  Some, or a Lot of Assembly Required

 The most intimidating part of any standing desk is the assembly. From [FlexiSpot’s Comhar Pro Standing Desk](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-essential-tips-for-youtube-shorts-success/) to the [Autonomous SmartDesk Core](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-corrupt-mp4-and-avi-files-of-realme-11-pro-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/), I have always struggled with assembly because I’m a one-person army tackling a two-person job. I didn’t expect Secretlab’s 5-foot desk to give me much more trouble, but the high-pressure laminate bamboo and steel metallic desktop with the hefty hydraulic legs challenged me some. They’re heavy, and you absolutely should have a second pair of hands.

 Otherwise, the desk is a fairly simple assembly. Everything with the MAGNUS Pro was compartmentalized in small kits to make installation a breeze.

###  Designed for Accessories and Enhancements

 Once the desk is assembled, there is an ecosystem of accessories and attachments to consider adding. Whereas most desks arrive as just a slab of pressed wood and two metallic legs, Secretlab set me up with a dual monitor arm, an under-the-table PC mount, a magnetic table-length mat, and a magnetic headphones hook. Surprisingly, the components integrated fairly easily, and it’s the first desk that truly feels like it’s meant to be expanded upon. Unfortunately, that does mean spending more money.

 The dual monitor arm clamps down in the wire well and takes up barely any space, and my favorite addition, the PC mount, keeps my tower off the floor but also securely out of my way with an adjustable, easy-to-assemble mount. I’ve had so many headphone mounts that screw into the desk and eventually loosen over time and fall out. Since this mount is magnetic, it should stay in place. Even the available RGB smart lights, which I did not test, are magnetized for convenient installation.

 The one accessory I struggled to fully love was the Signature Black desktop mat. It’s a beautiful black strip of leather that adheres firmly to the desk. But maybe black wasn’t the best choice because it shows smudges and debris very easily. I immediately know if a cat traipsed along my desk and can easily follow their tiny footprints.

 The metal desktop can be prone to scratching, so having to clean up the mat every so often is a worthwhile trade-off.

##  A Clean, Organized Desktop

 I don’t know what happened to me, but at some point in my life, I became completely averse to exposed wires. For previous reviews, I’ve gone to painstaking lengths to try and keep unnecessary wires from showing in my photos. So, it’s understandable then that the full-length, integrated cable management tray is my favorite feature of the Secretlab MAGNUS Pro. Attached to the rear of the desk via a few screws, the tray very neatly tucks away all cables. It works well with the dual arm monitor stand, which has its own built-in cable management system that ultimately feeds right into the desktop tray.

 While it’s a little tight and the hinged lid can be stiff, there’s more than enough room to house a power strip, which plugs right into the desk itself. The source of all your electricity is a plug at the base of one leg, which is, according to Secretlab, the “world’s first fully integrated power supply column.” It may be the first, but it absolutely shouldn’t be the last, and I’d be shocked if we didn’t start seeing more standing desks going this route.

 Not only does it keep all of your wires clean and organized, but it also cuts down on concerns over wire length when you’re raising the desk. With my prior standing desk, I ran into several issues of wires being too short to allow me to raise the desk to a comfortable height. With the Secretlab MAGNUS Pro, especially with the under-mounted PC storage, everything travels smoothly together.

##  Work Comfortably, All Day, Every Day

Secretlab MAGNUS Pro panel with three presets and a child lock switch

 Where Secretlab’s MAGNUS Pro aligns best with [other standing desks](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-by-drfone-android/) is its primary function. A built-in panel with three programmable buttons and a child lock allows you to set comfortable heights for working while sitting or standing. I will always recommend a standing desk to anyone who’s on their computer for several hours every day. Being able to [comfortably stand and work](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-mov-files-on-windows-11-os/) has done wonders for my back, and it’s even better if you throw a cushioned mat beneath your feet.

 The durable steel legs raise or lower the desktop from 25.6 inches to 49.2 inches rather quickly, stopping only when you want or when the sensitive anti-collision kicks in. It’s not whisper quiet, but you definitely won’t be waking the household by adjusting your desktop height. I didn’t run into any issues during height adjustment tests, even when experimenting with the 265-pound weight limit with my body weight.

 Secretlab may be a brand made for gamers, and the MAGNUS Pro may have some very pro-gamer features, but the desk works very well as a standard office desk.

##  Should You Buy Secretlab’s MAGNUS Pro Standing Desk?

 If you’re in the market for a new desk and want a standing desk, yes, you should consider buying the [Secretlab MAGNUS Pro Standing Desk](https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-pro). Most of my reviews end in a sort of “it depends on your situation” conclusion, but I think this model is a universal win for anyone who wants to work with the option of standing or sitting.

 Sure, the accessories can very quickly raise the price, but stuff like the under-mounted PC storage, full-length leather mat, and headset hook aren’t essentials. While the desk itself is on the costlier side, it’s one of those purchases that you won’t have to replace for years to come. If you take care of it—and that really amounts to using it as intended—it’s going to be with you for a very long time. Unlike a wooden desktop, I don’t suspect the metal top will show the same wear and tear over the years. Even if it does, you can buy a new mat to cover it and give it a refreshed appearance.

 As far as standing desks go, the MAGNUS Pro feels like a premium option. The range is ideal for anyone of average height, and the speed and noise output are more than manageable. I do wish there were storage options, like a magnetic drawer or anything to store my odds and ends. Then again, that’s one less thing to sink my money into as I’m completely addicted to outfitting my MAGNUS Pro with accessories.
