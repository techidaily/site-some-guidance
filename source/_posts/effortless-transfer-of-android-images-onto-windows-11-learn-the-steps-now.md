 You're mostly done. To confirm the connection has been established between your phone and PC, go to the Settings menu on the Link to Windows app on your phone. There you should see the name of your Windows desktop. If it's connected, then you should see the text "Connected." Otherwise, you'll see the text "Disconnected" written there. You'll also see the Link to Windows app logo in your notification panel with a connected status.

##  Getting the Photos on Your Desktop Through Notifications

 With everything set up, you can try taking a new photo or screenshot on your Android device. Once you do, you'll see an instant notification on your Windows desktop for that photo or screenshot.

![A notification being displayed on Windows 11 after taking a photo on Android](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/android-photo-notification-on-windows-11-1.png) 

 Once you tap the notification, the photo will open in the [Snipping Tool](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-selecting-excellent-steadicams-to-elevate-your-dslr-cinematic-outputs/). From there, you can edit the photo, open it in Paint, [copy it to your clipboard](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-cast-realme-c55-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/), use the [Text Actions feature](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-time-warp-in-video-editing/), or share it with others.

![An example of an Android photo opened in the Snipping Tool on Windows 11](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/android-photo-opened-in-the-snipping-tool.png) 

 If you accidentally miss the notification, you can still find it in the notification center. You can tap the date and time on the menu bar or press Windows+N to open the notification center.

![The Windows notification center displaying the Android photo notification](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/android-photo-notification-in-the-notification-panel-on-windows.png) 

 Another cool thing I found about this feature is that if you're on mobile data and not connected to the Wi-Fi on your phone, you can still use this feature. To do so, open the Link to Windows app. Go to Settings. Toggle the "Sync Over Mobile Data" button.

![Different settings of the Link to Windows app displayed](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/android-photo-transferred-on-mobile-data.png) 

 Now turn off the Wi-Fi and turn on your mobile data. Take a photo and see if you receive a notification on Windows.

##  Troubleshooting Common Issues You May Face

 While testing this feature, I found some issues where I wasn't able to get photo notifications. If you face such problems, you can follow some of these solutions:

1. Always make sure your phone is connected to the PC via the Link to Windows app. You may face sudden disconnects. If so, wait for them to be connected again.
2. Sometimes, letting the app run in the background helps. You can turn this setting on from the Link to Windows app on your phone.
3. Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
4. Sometimes, I didn't receive the notification until I minimized all the windows and tapped once on the home screen on my desktop. Weird, but it worked.
5. If you already have a screenshot opened in the Snipping Tool, another photo may not open when you tap on the notification.
6. Sometimes, the photo wouldn't open in the Snipping Tool if I pressed the notification from the notification center.
7. Disconnecting and reconnecting the devices also helped.
8. If you're unable to find the "Get New Photo Notifications" feature on your Windows PC, make sure you've installed the latest Windows updates and then try again.
