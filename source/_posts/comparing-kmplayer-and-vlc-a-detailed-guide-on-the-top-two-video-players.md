There are still many significant aspects they have in common or different from each other. Well, let's have a look in more detail. 

## KMP VS VLC Media Player: What Are the Trumps of KMP and VLC?

### KMPlayer

APerhaps you can't wait to know what the unique features KMPlayer and VLC have. Primarily, the former outshines the latter concerning its rare 3D format playback function, which allows you to experience the amazing 3D home cinema world with a low CPU Memory share and an optimized, stable playback supported by GPU. More thoughtfully, you can enjoy the wonderful 3D contents without downloading any 3D Movie Plus Apps.

In addition, KMPlayer also has an ace in the hole coming soon. That's Cloud KMP designed for you to easily and conveniently manage the media library files that were edited in the album art. Currently this new feature is being developed on an urgent basis. It's convincible that it's coming around the corner and will make your edited files be synchronized at anytime anywhere.

### VLC

Speaking of VL video player highlights, it's mentionable that VLC beats others hands down in its powerful knack to play the video content of incomplete, unfinished, or damaged video downloads before the files have been fully downloaded. And even confronted with some damaged video, it can hassle-free skip the error part and continue to smoothly play back the video with clear image provided.

Another shining point rests with VLC interior advanced tech supports which is superior to KMPlayer with no doubt. Take the system resource they needs for instance, it's tested that generally VLC for Android can save up to 80% system resource compared with KMP when they are playing the same video file. In such case, VLC is seemingly much more effective and energy-efficent.

KMPlayer and VLC have their pros and cons. It's hard to say which one is the best video player, since it eventually comes down to your own needs. If you are pursuing the media player to play back as many files formats as possible (even the incomplete files included) on any platform, then VLC media player is the second-to-none choice for you. And for those friends who plan to give 3D format a spin and expect to synchronize the customized files, KMPlayer is the ideal expert in this regard.
