## Part 2\. Get Zoom Meeting on Xbox One using Chromecast

It is already mentioned that Zoom doesn't support Xbox. You may be late because the XBOX has Zoom Rooms in their app store, which might help the users to get zoom meetings on the Xbox. But, recently, it got removed by Xbox from the App Store, which left Xbox gamers disconnected.

But there is nothing to worry about, and you might have heard the phrase "if there is a will, there is a way." You can also get a zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox with another option. That way is known as Screen Casting. It is a straightforward method of **using zoom on Xbox one**, but most ignored by many of its users. Let's look at how you can use a screencast by using Chromecast on the Xbox.

* For setting up a Zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox, at first, you will have to “plug in” Chromecast that is to Xbox One's HDMI port.
* Now, opt for moving to the Xbox Pins and then find the TV app; select to launch that application.
* After choosing the TV app, you will be told to connect the satellite box or cable. You can tap on the "A" button on the remote to select the option.
* After a few times, the Chromecast can get detected by Xbox One, which will appear in a small window. After that, at this point, the next button will get activated and once the button gets activated, click "Next."
* If you wish to set up the Xbox One for controlling the Casting Screen, tap on "Next." If it is not, you can click on "Skip" and move to the next screen.
* In the next window, choose what you wish to do after Xbox starts. You can select "On Start, Open TV or go home after it starts. After you select the option from the drop-down, you can now opt for clicking "Next" to complete the Chromecast setup.
* After successful setup, switch back to the casting device, i.e., iPhone, Android, iPad, Mac, Laptop or Desktop, etc.
* Now, opt to visit settings and then opt for clicking on the Cast.

## Part 3\. Setup Zoom Conference on Xbox

It is one of the most used apps amongst applications available. This application helps people in their meetings, business meetings, or group meetings. Here are the steps to help you set up a zoom conference on Xbox.

* At first, opt for downloading the Zoom rooms to Android devices, PC, MAC, iPhones, and iPad to get started.
* After the installation is done, you can open "The zoom app." The zoom rooms are also available on the Xbox.
* For linking your Xbox and device, opt for clicking on the option "Connect."
