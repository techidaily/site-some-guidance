### **Price:**

Even if you haven't bought any premium package, you can still use the VivaCut application and do simple editing for your videos. But the major con of using its free version is that it puts its watermark on the exported video, which may affect your video's look. To remove this watermark from your videos, you must purchase one of their premium packages (monthly or yearly). Moreover, if you want some more professional features, add INS or plugins and effects in it and remove the ads from it, you also have to purchase their premium version.

However, there are a few limitations regarding it if you are using the free version: you can only export videos for up to five minutes.

### Primary Editing

As we discussed earlier, you can use almost all the essential editing tools, whether using a free or a premium version. You can quickly get all these tools at the bottom of your mobile's screen.

A menu will appear at the bottom of your mobile's screen from which you can click on the filters or AI effects option, whatever you want to use. In the free version, you have only access to the limited filters, and AI effects are not available.

### Chroma Key

Chroma Key is another excellent feature in the VivaCut video editor, which you can use to change your video's background easily. To use this feature in your videos, you must click on the video layer and select the Chroma key option from the menu at the bottom.

Also, as we discussed earlier, we need a premium version to export videos longer than five minutes.
