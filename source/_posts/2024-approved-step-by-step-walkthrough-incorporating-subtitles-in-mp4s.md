## Part 2: How do I add subtitles to a video without any software?

Although using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software is the best way to add SRT to MP4, you can also get the job done without downloading any software. One of the few online tools that allows this kind of operation is Clideo. Yes, Clideo can be used to attach SRT files to MP4 quickly and easily.

With Clideo, you can add subtitles to a video on any device including Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone. Plus, it supports basic editing features that can always come in handy to make the addition of Subtitles do video just like a walk in the park.
