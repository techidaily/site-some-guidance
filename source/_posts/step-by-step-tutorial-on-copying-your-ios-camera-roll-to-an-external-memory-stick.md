## How to Transfer Pictures  from iPhone to a USB Flash Drive

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/../image-style/new-seo/icon6.png) By [Rico Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rico-rodriguez-06815a104/) to iPhone Photos | Last Updated on Dec 18, 2023 

I'm running on an iPhone with 64GB storage space and the OS consumes 6.36GB. Thus, the rest of available space is 57.64GB. Most photos taken by iPhone are 2576x1932 (main camera) and 1280x980 (selfie camera), with roughly 5.38MB and 278KB respectively in file size. Therefore, only 3122 photos take up 19.18GB on my iPhone. Of course, your photo storage consumption will be much smaller if you're using a newer iPhones since they supports you to shoot pictures in HEIC codec with almost 50% smaller in size. 

Anyway, no matter which iPhone model you possess, the photos would be ranked at the first or the second place of the top space consumption list. So to free up iPhone space, you can consider to move and transfer iPhone photos to a USB flash drive for backup. Yet, what size USB drive do you need for photos? We list out the common used USB drive with maximum photos number for your reference.



## What Size USB Drive do You Need to Buy for Photos?

| Size of USB Drive | Still Photos                                  | HDR Still Photos | Live Photos | HDR Live Photos |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 16GB              | 3092 - 60350  (based on different resolution) | 16384            | 6580        | 6159            |
| 64GB              | 12368 - 0.241 million                         | 65536            | 26320       | 24636           |
| 128GB             | 24736 - 0.482 million                         | 0.131 million    | 52640       | 49272           |

The above table is the estimation photo number for your reference. If you use iPhone 7 or later iPhone to shoot photos in HEIC, the output image file would become 50% larger than it is on iPhone after you transfer it from iPhone to computer. Cuz the HEIC photos would automatically be converted to JPG during sync.

With advanced GPU hardware acceleration tech supports, this iPhone manager makes batch photo transfer up to 5X faster than any other competitors. More strengthes sets it apart from others:

### Step 1: Free Download MacX MediaTrans 

[Free download this iPhone manager on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and then fire it up. Afterwards, connect your iPhone or old iPhone to Macbook Pro/Air, iMac, Mac Mini or iMac Pro via USB cable. If the connection failed, unplug your iPhone and try it again via another USB port.

Note: 1\. there will pop up a window to advise you to properly set iTunes lest your file data gets lost. So please follow the prompts to set iTunes first.   
 2\. This software needs iTunes to activate your iPhone at the first place. But when it comes to [transfer iPhone photos to Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), there's nothing to do with iTunes.

### Step 2: Choose Photos to Transfer

Tap Photos icon at the main home > opt for the pictures you plan to transfer. Firstly, choose photo album at the left side. As you can see, all your photos are well organized by photo style and source, including camera roll selfies, panoramas, bursts, third party apps. Secondly, click the drop-down list at Group to select photo management mode: By Day, By Week, By Month or By Year. Thirdly, manually select certain iPhone images or directly tick "Select All".

Insert your USB flash drive to your computer and then import photos from MBP/MacBook/iMac Pro to your USB drive. After the transfer completes, create some new folders to organize your photos on your USB drive if necessary.

On top of iPhone photos transfer feature, [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) also has the power to transfer videos, music, ringtones, eBooks, iTunes purchases, iTunes U, etc. between iPhone and MBP/Macbook/iMac Pro (two-way solution).

Thus, even though your Mac computer is under others' control, your personal data are still secure with only you.
