## Transform Your Typography: The 3D Text Technique Explained PSX

It's three times better than regular text. A 3D text looks more professional, more creative, and just sits better on most pieces of content. Regardless of whether you need it for an image or for one of your videos. This guide will show you how to make a 3D text effect in Photoshop.

Then, you'll learn about an alternative method that's actually much easier. It may not be as popular as Photoshop but you will be surprised by the professional results even a beginner can achieve with this.

## How to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop is not the easiest image editing software to use. It can get really complex, really fast. But, with this, all you have to do is follow our steps. We'll try to make it as straightforward as possible.

Step1 Open up Adobe Photoshop and create a New Document. Then, edit the document settings like this.

Step3 Now, locate the **Layers** panel at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on **Layers** **→ right-click on your Text layer → select "New 3D Extrusion from Selected Layer".** Then, just click **Yes** on the new window that pops up.
