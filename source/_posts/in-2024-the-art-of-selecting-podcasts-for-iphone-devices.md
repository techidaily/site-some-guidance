When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details. A summary of the podcast's topic, ratings, genre, and other information is included in the additional details. The most recent episode of that podcast should be the one that appears at the top. Earlier episodes can be listened to by scrolling down and selecting the one you want to hear.

You can choose to subscribe or unfollow the podcast you're listening to. By subscribing to a podcast, you can stay updated on new content and forthcoming episodes.
