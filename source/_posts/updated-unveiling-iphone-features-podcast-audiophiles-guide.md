## Why Can't I Play a Podcast on My iPhone?

2. Relaunch the Apple Podcasts app. You can swipe up and close an app while multitasking on an iPhone or iPad. Mac users can quit the application by right-clicking on the dock icon and choosing Quit. When you reopen the app, try hearing the podcast once more.
3. Ensure the appropriate audio output is chosen.
4. Redownload the podcast after erasing it from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. When downloaded, files can sometimes become corrupt.
5. Verify the quality of your Wi-Fi or cellular data connection.
6. Restart your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Giving your device a new start may resolve a persistent glitch or connection issue.
