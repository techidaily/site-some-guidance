##  What Is Safe Mode?

[Safe mode is essentially a troubleshooting service](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-scripting-instant-stopwatch-integration-in-obs-for-2024/). If you're using unstable hardware drivers that cause you to see the [blue screen of death](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-approaches-to-ppt-video-captures/) or if you've been infected with malware, launching Windows 10 in safe mode allows you to boot up your PC to get to the root cause of the problem. In some cases, it may be your only way to start your PC without reinstalling Windows.

 Why? Because, when you start Windows 10 in safe mode, [startup programs](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/get-clarity-back-in-photos-how-to-repair-iphone-camera-focusing-problems/) and other services configured to start on startup aren't launched, hardware support is minimized, [screen resolution](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleashing-your-brand-potential-with-advanced-insights-on-instagram-data/) is decreased, and no third-party software or drivers are enabled.
