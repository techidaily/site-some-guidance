_I'm working with a Canon Vixia HG20 HD camcorder, Mac 10.10.3, and iMovie HD 6\. The camera is not recognized by iMovie, but I figured that would happen. So I'm left with a bunch of .mts files on the camera. I've tried all the free trials I could find (like iSquint, MPEG Streamclip, ClipWrap), they either put a giant watermark over the video or have a time limit. Is there some program that can completely and freely convert MTS files into MP4 or MOV, etc? Thank you. -- Yahoo Answers_
