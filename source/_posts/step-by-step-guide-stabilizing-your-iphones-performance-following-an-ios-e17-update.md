### Solution 1\. Update iPhone to the latest iOS

Fortunately, the new iOS releases come with a fix. If your iPad or iPhone keeps restarting randomly or over and over due to a software bug, an iOS update will solve the problem. To update iPhone to iOS latest version, go to Settings > General > Software Update. Considering that your iPhone keeps rebooting constantly, you'd better update via iTunes, or resort to a much easier third-party [iPhone backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) tool to make the process faster. 

### Solution 2\. Change Date & Time manually

After iOS reboots iPhone randomly, users have taken immediate actions to fix the problem. One of the effective measures is to change the date on their phone to before December 2\. For "iPhone keeps restarting" errors with other iOS versions, you can also try to change the Auto update Data & Time: Settings app > General > Date & Time > manully set the date and time. 

### Solution 3\. Check for any faulty apps

Though iOS is regarded as the most secure system that can protect iPhone from bad apps, some users may have their ways to download new apps. An app failure can cause iPad and iPhone randomly restarts and crashes. First, check if there is any new version for any app and update. Second, check if you have downloaded any third-party apps or updated app before your iPhone rebooting. Then delete the problem apps to see if the problem is solved.

### Solution 4\. Reset all settings

Reset all settings can sometimes fix certain issues with the software. So when your iPad iPhone restarts itself randomly, resetting all settings is also a fix to try. Before you start, you should note that Reset All Settings will reset the iPhone like new and the settings will be gone. To do this, launch the Settings app > tap General > tap Reset at the bottom and then tap Reset All Settings. You may have to reenter your passcode to do so. Check the detailed guide on [how to reset iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

### Solution 5\. Restore iPhone from backup

A backup is essential when things go wrong, and restoring an iPhone or iPad from an iCloud or iTunes backup is a great way to get your iPad iPhone restarting loop back to normal. As iCloud has a 5GB limit and iTunes is quite troublesome and time-consuming. We don't want problems occur one after another and you can use an easier backup & restore tool when iPhone randomly restarts. For example, [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), which will transfer backed up photos, videos, movies, audio, ringtone, books etc from Mac to iPhone via drag and drop.

### Solution 6\. Clean iPhone's charging port 

There are many users reporting that iPad iPhone keeps restarting when charging and [iPhone won't charge](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) properly, or wireless charging for iPhone.
