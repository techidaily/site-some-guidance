## Part I: What is Edgenuity?

Edgenuity is an e-learning platform that provides students with a linear preparation model. Several colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States have used it to supplement their curricula. This platform assists students with their academic work.

It provides students various services and content, such as course outlines, essay questions, research guidebooks, and much more. Let's look at the necessary skills and how to bypass the Edgenuity videos below.

## Part II. When will the students want to skip videos on Edgenuity?

Keeping people interested in a video they've already seen takes time and effort. It's even more difficult to keep people entertained when they know they'll be bored by the end of the videoâ€”as is the case with educational videos.

Moreover, they lack genuine content. Most of the time, a teacher will tell you what to do for your homework and then hand you an assignment sheet with it written down.

![long educational videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/long-educational-videos.jpg)

When students are confused about the material, they will look for shortcuts. The best way to deal with this is to provide them multiple opportunities to learn each concept. Students will also want to skip the videos when there is too much text or questions on the same topic and if they are bored, distracted, or do not care about the content.

Students should be engaged by the material shown when watching educational videos. They should be able to comprehend the material and apply it to their own lives.

## Part III: Why the students can't skip videos on Edgenuity?

### Features on Filmora Teachers Could Use to Improve Educational Videos

**Text to Speech**

Text-to-speech technology lets machines read text aloud with natural-sounding voices. Educators can use this to add narration to educational videos. That helps explain the lessons better.

Type a narration and add it to the parts of the video where they are needed. Then, use text-to-speech.

**Screen Recorder**

The screen recorder feature is handy for lessons that need a lot of explaining or demonstration. It will let you convert the Paint app or another app into a digital whiteboard.

![screen recording software for teachers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/screen-recording-software-teachers.jpg)

One example is when teaching students how blood circulates. How does blood enter the heart, and how does it exit it? You can screen record a video of you explaining that through drawing arrows in an app.

**Split Screen**

You can utilize the split screen feature when teaching the differences between things. Use one screen to show one of the subjects and one for the thing you are comparing it with. For example, on one screen, you can show how Reykjavik, Iceland looks at 8 pm. On the other screen, show what it looks like at Reykjavik's antipodal point at the same time.
