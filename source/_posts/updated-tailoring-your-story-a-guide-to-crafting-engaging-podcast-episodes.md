**Steps for editing a podcast on Apple mobile device with GarageBand**

For iphone and iPad users, the steps are much easier than operating on a desktop. You can refer to the short video below to get started quickly.

**Steps to edit a podcast on Mac with GarageBand**

##### Step1 Innstall GarageBand on mac

GarageBand can be installed on macOS 12.3 or later. Please ensure your current mac version or keep updates before installing the latest version of the GarageBand software on your Mac.

##### Step2 Launch GarageBand after installing

Click Project Templates, choose the Voice option and click the Choose button from the bottom right corner.

![launch garageband after installing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-1.jpg)

##### Step3 Input podcast audio

You'll be prompted to select your podcast audio input. Select the source from the Input pop-up menu under the Recording Settings area, then click the Input button to switch between stereo input channels and mono input channels.

![input podcast audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-2.jpg)

##### Step4 Setup Work Space

The workspace to edit your podcast will be displayed on your Mac screen. You just have to navigate to the top section displaying time and beat, then change the settings so that it'll show only the time.

![setup work space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-3.jpg)

##### Step5 Create Different Audio Track for Podcast

Navigate to the section displaying the Audio 1 track. Then, use the Plus icon at the top left corner to add the tracks for different parts of your podcast. For example, Audio 1- Intro, Audio 2 - Intro voice, Audio 3 - Transition Music, Audio 4, Guest interview, etc.

![create different audio track for podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-4.jpg)

##### Step6 Import the Recorded Podcast Files

Now, open the location where you saved the different parts of the podcast file and drag-n-drop it to the timeline right in front of the relevant audio track. See the screenshot below;

![import the recorded podcast files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-5.jpg)

##### Step7 Adjust Audio Level

Next, adjust the audio level for each track containing different parts of your podcast according to your requirements. It helps you maintain an excellent audio balance if the audio in one track is louder than the others. For example, if your interviewed guest sounded not so loud, you can increase the audio level of the audio track containing that part of the podcast by using the relevant button.

![adjust audio level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-6.jpg)

##### Step8 Use Solo Tool

You can also solo specific tracks in your podcast by clicking the Solo feature. It allows you to detect unwanted noise in the podcast easily. All you have to do to use the Solo feature is to click the Headphones button next to each track to listen to a specific audio track.

![use solo tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-7.jpg)

You can also use the mute button to silence the audio tracks you don't want to be heard in your podcast.

![use the mute button to silence the audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-8.jpg)

##### Step9 Setup File Structure

Name the folders, subfolders, and session files for each part of your podcast. Doing this will help you quickly locate all related documents anytime needed. Also, it's advisable to stay consistent with a particular file structure.

##### Step10 Export Edited Podcast

Once you complete the editing operation, navigate to the menu bar and choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialogue, enter a new name for the project, then click Save.

The above steps should help you edit podcasts on GarageBand efficiently.

## Part 2\. GarageBand errors? Why fail to edit, and how to fix

Unfortunately, we encountered some critical errors while using the GarageBand software to edit podcasts. These errors were due to technique or file format problems. The following are the errors you might encounter while using GarageBand to edit podcasts and their perfect fix.

### Error 1: Error while synchronizing audio and MIDI

![error while synchronizing audio and midi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-9.jpg)

Sometimes, GarageBand fails to synchronize audio and MDI. It happens because the app detected an unusual sample rate that it's unable to process.

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

* Change USB Connection
* Close Background Apps
* Check Sample Rate
* Change the current mic you're using
* Create New Profile on the GarageBand app.

### Error 2: "greyed out" MP3/audio files in GarageBand

![greyed out mp3 or audio files in garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-10.jpg)

GarageBand does not allow the upload of MP3 files with unsupported codecs. So, suppose the podcast file you try to upload is greyed out. Then, chances are GarageBand does not support its codec.

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

To fix this error, you have to change the file from .mp3 to .wav. If you're using your iPhone, you can use a file converter app to operate. But if you're on a macOS, you need to locate the podcast MP3 file, right-click on it, then rename it to be in .wav format.

This [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CeuA1shy1u4) should walk you through the process better.

### Error 3: The save file operation failed

![the save file operation failed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-11.jpg)

Another error is the inability to save the file. But this is usually due to problems like running an outdated macOS or iOS, insufficient storage space, Mac or iPhone errors, etc. The best way to fix this error is to do the following;

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

* Update your macOS or iOS to the latest version
* Free up storage space
* Check background running apps and close them.
* Restart your device.

### Error 4: The operation could not be completed

![the operation could not be completed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-12.jpg)

This error kept occurring when we tried to open a project in GarageBand, though it did not appear when we tried to create a new project. It might be due to an outdated version of the app, or there are bugs in your device that compromise the operation.

**Here is how you can fix this error**

* Check for the GarageBand's new update and update it if there's a new version.
* Restart your device.
* Force the app to close.
* Update your device to its latest version.
* Delete the app and download it again.

## Part 3\. What's good and not good about GarageBand
