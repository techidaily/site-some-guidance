### 7\. Ventura install is stuck 

Updating to macOS Ventura 12 from macOS Big Sur might take significantly longer than expected. There are users who tried to download Ventura installer via system update for hours. But [Ventura download gets stuck](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and the progress bar stops at some point like 25% or even 100%. Some others get stuck on "Preparing macOS Ventura 12.1 Update..." Rebooting and re-downloading the system won't fix. 

* Shut down your computer, restart it and hold down the shift button until it starts in safe mode. Then redownload Ventura.
* Restart/refresh your Internet connection to avoid any network connectivity errors.
* Close any app that requires large amount of CPU, uninstall it and try again.
* Try to update macOS 13 Ventura again after rebooting in recovery mode.
* Try to update macOS 13 Ventura via the APP Store.
* If the [macOS Ventura download gets stuck](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), there is high likelihood that Apple servers is overwhelmed. Give it sufficient time, wait patiently, or simply cancel the download. It might be much better to re-download macOS Ventura tomorrow.

![macOS Ventura update stuck](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/monterey-stuck.jpg) 

macOS Ventura update stuck

### 8\. macOS Ventura update error with non-Apple SSD

_"I cannot upgrade from Big Sur (11.6.1) to Ventura. When attempting to run the installer from the applications folder, it fails to restart and prompts me to launch the application again. So I created a bootable USB using createinstallmedia and that progresses further, but during the restart process, it eventually fails with a "Mac os a required firmware update could not be installed. Compatible internal storage is required in order to update.' error message. It then launches the startup disk dialog and I reboot back into Big Sur."_

If you get the same firmware upgrade error during Ventura update, or if the Ventura fails to update/install for reasons you don't know, check if you have a non-Apple SSD installed. An Apple internal SSD has to be installed in order to update the EFI firmware and OS boot loader. Therefore, you're recommended to reinstall the original Apple SSD, install Ventura to get the EFI update, then replace the Apple SSD with the OWC SSD or other non-Apple SSD, and upgrade from Big Sur 11.6.1 to Ventura. 

### 9\. Screen Saver not working after Ventura update

After the macOS 13 Ventura update, some users found their Screen Saver was not working, no matter which option (e.g., Classic, Ken Burns, etc.) they chose. When selecting the Photos library or a folder of photos, they would not render. The problem happens on iMac, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. It's annoying for those who use this Screen Saver to choose photos frequently. If your Screen Saver is broken in Ventura, try: 

* Set the Source to "Photos Library" and give some time to the system photos library to open and to show the list of albums. Then try again to select an album from the list of albums.
* The Screen Saver problem is that if you snooze the source of the photos you will see that the folder is empty. Just change the SOURCE destinationation.

### 10\. macOS Ventura update not enough free space

If the macOS 13software won't install and says "There is not enough free space on the selected volume to upgrade the OS. An additional GB.MB is required", make sure you have more than 20GB of space on your Mac to download and install macOS Ventura successfully. However, if there are enough storage avaiable on your Mac and you still get the Ventura update problem, try this:

* Clear the local snapshots of Time Machine stored locally on your Mac. To do this, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Time Machine. Turn off "Back Up Automatically". If that doesn't work, then delete the snapshots manually in the terminal: type tmutil listlocalsnapshots / and then type sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2020-06-01-002010;
* Sign out from AppStore -> Restart Mac -> Sign in to AppStore -> Download Xcode;
* Download the installer on an external hard drive and try again.

### 11\. Hide My Email not working in Ventura

Some users reported that hid my email not working after the Ventura update. In the iCloud system preferences, it will prompt the error message saying "Not Available - Please try again later". 

* First, try it again a few hours later. Just be patient and give it some time
* You can also try signing out of iCloud and back in again.
* The last resort is to perform a clean install and apply your time machien backup. But this may be troublesome for some users.

### 12\. Slow Calendar after Ventura Update 

Many users have reported the slow Calendar problems after they update to Ventura. Since the Ventura update the calendar is very slow and there are slow syncing, spinning wheels, short freezes and delays in Calendar when switching between days/weeks view.
