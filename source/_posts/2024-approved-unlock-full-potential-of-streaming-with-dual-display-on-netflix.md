## Unlock Full Potential of Streaming with Dual Display on Netflix

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps. You can now bake a cake or iron your clothes while watching something on **Netflix**. But did you know that you can also do this kind of multitasking on your device? Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

Android users have long enjoyed the use of a floating window on their devices. And now, this function is available for iOS users as well. The picture-in-picture function involves a floating window that can be resized and moved across the screen. You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

### PiP on Mac

Mac differs from Windows in the sense that it doesn't have an actual app for Netflix. Instead, you can watch your videos by using the web browser.

The picture-in-picture feature is available if you are using the Google Chrome browser. If you're using a Linux or Windows computer, you can also work with the following method.

1. First, launch **Google Chrome** on your device.
1. Open [**com**](https://www.netflix.com/) and select a movie or show.
1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.

Your video will now appear through a floating window. This window can be resized and freely dragged around the screen. You can now do other tasks with your device while you enjoy your Netflix show.

### PiP on Windows

Using the picture-in-picture feature on Windows is simpler than on other PC devices. If you have a device with a **Windows 10** version or higher, you can activate your floating window with only a few easy steps.

1. The first step is to open the **Netflix app** which is available for Windows 10 users and higher.
1. **Play** a video from the app.
1. The **PiP** **button** is displayed at the bottom right corner. Simply click the button to transfer your video to a floating window.

Freely resize and move the window on any side of your screen. You can now watch your Netflix videos while using other apps or programs on your computer.

1. Choose a show in the app and tap the **play button**.
1. **Swipe up** the screen to return to the home screen.

Your selected Netflix video is now visible through the floating window. You are now able to watch your favourite shows while chatting, sending an email, or surfing the internet.

1. Open **Settings**, then proceed to **Apps and Notifications**.
1. Expand the **Advanced**
1. Select **Special app access.**

## Part 3\. Why is the Netflix Picture-in-Picture Mode Not Working On My iPhone?

Make sure to check your device's software version to ensure that it is updated to support the feature. For iPhone users, the software version should be 14.0 or higher. Picture-in-picture is a device compatible with all iPhone types that can support the software.

If PiP is still not working, double-check if your Netflix app is updated. Older versions of the app do not have this function.

Lastly, take a look at your phone settings to confirm that Picture-in-Picture is indeed enabled.

If the following methods don't work, you can disable and enable the settings again or consider restarting the phone.
