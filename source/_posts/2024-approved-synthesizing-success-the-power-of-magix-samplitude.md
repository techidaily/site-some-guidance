![fl studio the best daw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/fl-studio-the-best-daw.jpg)

So, which one is better? Magix Music Maker or [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)? To answer this question, we've provided a quick verdict below:

### Verdict

Magix Music Maker is a great entry-level DAW but lacks the features and depth that FL studio offers. The latter includes more advanced features, mixing tools, and a synthesizer for music production, making music sound more professional.

On the G2 platform, Fl Studio is rated as:

* 8.8 for meets requirements
* 8.7 for ease of use
* 8.1 for ease of setup
* 8.3 for ease of admin
* 8.2 for the quality of support

On the other hand, Magix Music Maker 2023 is rated as:

* 9.0 for meets requirements
* 8.2 for ease of use
* 8.7 for the quality of support
* No ratings for ease of setup and ease of admin as this has yet to be discovered by music creators.

FL Studio is perfect for professional music producers as it offers more advanced tools. In contrast, the Music Maker 2023 is best for beginners due to its intuitive and simple interface.
