## Part 1: Why Do Your Photos Come Out Blurry?

Do you know what the actual reasons for blurry photos are? In this section, you can learn the main causes of blurry pictures in a well-structured manner.

### 1\. Shaky Camera

Many people don’t know how to hold cameras professionally or appropriately. Moreover, if you are not using a tripod to take pictures smoothly, you will get blurry photos as a result. Hence, a shaky camera can be the biggest reason for blurry photos.

### 2\. Excessive Use of Filters

Filters are applied to enhance the visual appearance of your photos. However, if you use excessive filters for your captured pictures, it will eventually reduce the quality of the images. It will result in a pixelated and blur photo that will display an artificial look of your subject.

### 3\. Poor Lens Results

Camera lenses play a vital role in taking high-resolution photos. If your camera is old, it might be possible that the quality of your camera lens deteriorates. Furthermore, you will get blurry photos if there are scratches and smudges on your camera lens.
