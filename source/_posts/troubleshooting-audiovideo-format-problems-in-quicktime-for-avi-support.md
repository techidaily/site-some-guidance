QuickTime can't play AVI video compressed with MPEG-4, MPEG-HD etc other than Motion JPEG.
2. QuickTime doesn't recognize or play AVI with audio. Mostly because the audio codec is unsupported by QuickTime.
3. It's reported that QuickTime no longer played AVI file after updating to new macOS. The installed codec or Perian are the issues that cause AVI not playing on QT. Perian may not be compatible with the new OS you upgraded to.
