 People love the 6 rotor type design of Typhoon because it helps a drone to stay perfectly in air even if one motor fails suddenly. It comes with quick release type propellers that are very easy to install as well as remove. One cooler feature of Typhoon is its foldable arms that help to make it compact enough for packing when you have to go for travelling. The sonar collision detection sensors help to avoid all distractions on the way and keep your device safe from crashes. Further, its real sense technology makes it able to navigate around objects that are detected by collision detection sensor.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 As per the box specifications, this drone comes with a 5400mAh/ 14.8V/ 79.9 Wh battery that allows maximum flight time of 25 minutes in normal conditions. You will feel little annoying to know that its battery takes about 2 hours to get completely charged. So you have to wait so long to make it fly again.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 Typhoon offers 25 minutes flight time with the maximum speed of 45 meters per hour. This drone is designed with five unique modes for flight; one of these is the journey mode that helps to take of automatically and then starts taking selfie. You can activate follow me and watch me mode on this device and it will keep on following you over your path while keeping camera pointed towards your movements. One latest feature is Curve Cable Cam that helps users to program complete route for drone with pre set coordinates whereas camera positions can be controlled separately. If you switch to orbit me mode then it will start flying in circular direction but camera stays locked to control position. Further, the point of interest mode makes this drone to rotate around a fixed subject as per user's selection. You will definitely love its return to home feature that helps it to land safely to original position.

#### 5\.  Obstacle Avoidance

 Typhoon H is equipped with a built in type obstacle avoidance sensor that can find all distractions easily around and keeps your drone safe from crashes. It works with sonar technology that means your device can easily detect all the undesired objects on the way even in low light conditions or in darkness.

But still, at least you have a new feature and it works amazingly.
