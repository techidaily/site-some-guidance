 Taking up less desktop space than a can of Polar sparkling water (I have one sitting right next to it for comparison), the Ugreen Nexode is 2.35 inches wide, 3.5 inches tall, 2 inches from front to back and weighs 1.98 pounds. The matte gray finish allows the charger to blend into most traditional workstation arrangements, studies, and bedside tables. All the charging ports are on the front of the Nexode, which includes two USB-C PD ports (up to 100W) and one USB-A (up to 22.5W).

 The MagSafe-certified Qi charging pad is located on top of the hub and can flip forward up to 65 degrees. This makes it ideal for [docking your iPhone](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/elevating-video-experience-non-youtube-hubs-explained/) or Samsung Galaxy device for both portrait and landscape viewing, and [the Qi charger](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) delivers up to 15W to your mobile device. I also found it to be a convenient charging spot for my AirPods Pro 2 case.

 The bottom of the Nexode is padded with silicone around the edges, which protects your surfaces from scratches and dings, and prevents the charger from sliding around. The only thing on the back of the unit is the power input.

 The supplied power cable is just long enough to make sense for most tabletop situations. I did find that because of its stiff jacketing, the cable had a tendency to float and bend in ways I didn’t want it to, but moving the Nexode a bit usually solved this issue.

##  Charging: Power and Efficiency Wins the Race

 I used the Ugreen Nexode to charge several of my everyday workstation components, and it was one of the best charging hubs I've ever had on my desktop. Not only was it ultra-convenient for me to have all three USB inputs on the front of the charger, but I also used the Qi charging pad multiple times per day.

 I have a bad habit of leaving the Roku app open on my iPhone overnight, which usually drains my phone battery. Instead of having to leave my phone plugged in to charge in another room (which is what I usually do), I was able to slap it on the Nexode’s MagSafe pad. At 8:33 the battery was at 46%, and by 9:36 it was all the way up to 88%.

 Ugreen claims that the Nexode can also recharge a MacBook from dead to 50% battery life in half an hour (using a compatible USB-C cable). I’m pleased to say that I can verify this claim, as my late 2020 MacBook Pro went from 40% battery to 95% in thirty minutes, with no other devices connected. With my iPhone 12 docked for MagSafe charging, my MacBook took around forty-five minutes to go from 55% battery to 80%, while my iPhone went from 35% battery to just shy of 60%.

 In terms of USB output, the Nexode supplies different wattages based on how many ports are being used. A single USB-C port delivers up to 100W and the USB-A pushes 22.5W. When using two ports, USB-C goes down to 65W, while the second one pushes 30W. If one USB-C port is being used, it pushes 65W while USB-A outputs 22.5W.

 When three ports are used, one USB-C drops to 45W, and the second drops to 30W. USB-A remains at 22.5W. When all three ports _and_ the charging pad are used, you’ll get 45W from one USB-C, 25W from the second, 10W from USB-A and 15W from the charging pad.

##  Other Features: GaN is Your Charging Hub’s Best Friend

 Ugreen is one of several companies that incorporates GaN technology whenever it can. In the case of the bite-sized Nexode 100W, an integrated GaNFast II chip operates behind the scenes, keeping the Nexode running cool and efficiently, even when charging multiple devices at once.

 The Nexode is also equipped with temperature protection to prevent the hub from overheating, short-circuit safeguarding, and the ability to automatically optimize charging output based on what devices are connected to what ports (or the charging pad).

 I want to buy two right now, because I think the [Ugreen Nexode 100W 2-in-1 GaN Charger](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-Charger-Wirless-Stand/dp/B0BQBK2NLZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000350&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-100w-2-in-1-gan-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is one of the best miniature charging hubs I’ve ever tested.

The Ugreen Nexode 100W 2-in-1 GaN Charging Station includes two USB-C PD ports, one USB-A and a Qi-certified wireless charging pad at the top of the device. The charging pad can be tilted forward up to 65 degrees and the hub itself can easily be incorporated into desktop workstations.
