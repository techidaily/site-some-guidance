![The box contents of the Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jabra-evolve2-65-flex-and-its-accessories-on-a-workbench-2jpg_52843153415_o.jpg) 

_Jason Montoya / How-To Geek_

 The [Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228088/https://www.jabra.com/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve2-65-flex) is 7.87 inches wide, 6.1 inches tall, 4.25 inches from front to back, and weighs 0.3 pounds. Having also reviewed the [Evolve2 55](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228088/https://www.jabra.com/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve2-55), one of the most noticeable differences between both models is the location of the boom mic. Frankly, I found it somewhat irritating that the 55 Series microphone couldn't be folded against or inside of the right ear cup, so I was very happy to see that Jabra decided to incorporate a convenient holster for the boom on the 65 Flex model. Actually, at first glance, I thought this model didn't even include the boom because, out of the box, it's already tucked into its right ear-cup cavity.

 As far as buttons go, a power toggle/Bluetooth pairing button and the noise-canceling button are on the left ear cup, along with the 65 Flex's USB-C charge/sync port. Your volume controls, action button, and microphone-mute switch are located on the right ear cup. Depending on the version of the headset you've purchased (more on that below), a Microsoft Teams button may or may not be found on the outside part of the right ear cup.

 While both the Evolve2 55 and Evolve2 65 Flex feature rotatable ear-cups, one major difference between them is that the 65 Flex includes a collapsible headband, making it super-easy to tuck these bad boys into a backpack or laptop sleeve.

 In terms of actual drivers, the 65 Flex sports 28mm speakers in both ear-cups, and the boom mic is easy to fold out and tuck away. The Evolve2 65 Flex also offers some of the coziest padding you'll find on a set of workplace headphones. Utilizing Jabra's AirComfort technology (which can also be found on the Evolve2 55), both the ear cups and headband are outfitted with this ultra-comfortable material, and I'll happily go on record to say that the Evolve2 65 is one of the most comfortable headsets I've worn in a while.

 There are a few different versions of the Evolve2 65 Flex, too. The headset can be purchased in both USB-A and USB-C configurations, and you also have the choice of Microsoft Teams or Unified Communication (UC) models. And in terms of charging, you'll have the option of a charge stand or no charge stand. For my review, I tested the Microsoft Teams-optimized model with USB-C charging and the wireless charging stand. The latter peripheral is powered by a USB-C cable (an AC power brick is required). Whenever you want to charge the 65 Flex, just make sure the left ear cup rests on the top of the charging pad.

 The Evolve2 65 Flex also comes with [Jabra's Link 380 Bluetooth adapter](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228088/https://www.jabra.com/accessories/jabra-link-380), which you'll need to pair the headset to the Jabra Direct Software (more on this below) and whatever Bluetooth-compatible hardware you'd like to link the 65 Flex to.

##  Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation: Better Than Expected

 When it comes to workplace phone calls, dialing down on office chatter and other environmental sounds is critical. And when it comes to noise-canceling tech, the 65 Flex does a fairly decent job at cutting down on distractions. And with Jabra's Hybrid [Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/), the headset detects and cancels out unwanted frequencies, both for you and whoever you're on a call with.

 So how does Jabra's Hybrid ANC work in action? Pretty good, especially when compared to the Evolve2 55 I tested. For whatever reason, the Evolve2 55 had a tough time reducing noise, even with ANC cranked all the way up in the Jabra Sound+ app. As for the 65 Flex, though, I noticed a big reduction in environmental noise the moment I put the headset on.

 In my apartment, our HVAC system is located right next to my office, and when the AC runs, it sounds like a never-ending spacecraft launch. Not with the 65 Flex, though. While I was still able to hear some general AC noise in the background, gone was the constant rumbling of the system's fan. The 65 Flex's ANC also held up well against the noise machine we use to block out the irritating tweets of the newborn birds right outside our bedroom window. Even with ANC reduced to 50% in the Sound+ app, the 65 Flex was able to pull out a lot of the low-end gravitas in the "fan" sound we use, leaving nothing but a clean hiss to let me know the noise machine was indeed still running.

 And when it comes to ANC for the office or call center, well-balanced ANC will help to cut down on distant conversations while still allowing for closer dialogue to be heard. Standing on my apartment porch in the evening, I could barely hear the basketball game taking place about 70 feet away from me, but when conversing with my girlfriend inside our home, I could hear everything she was saying to me. Now in the event that ANC becomes a little too overwhelming, Jabra also incorporates a HearThrough mode into its Evolve2 headsets, which amplifies certain in-proximity sounds, making it easier to hear nearby people talking. To switch from ANC to HearThrough, just press the noise-canceling button on the left ear cup.

##  Sound Quality: Powerful to a Point

 I was a big fan of the Evolve2 55's sound quality, and while I was aware that the 28mm drivers on the 65 Flex were smaller than the 38mm drivers on the 55 Series, I believed that Jabra could still bring bold and balanced sound-staging to its slightly smaller headset. And while I was pleased with the results, the difference of 10mm could certainly be heard.

 For testing purposes, I listened to a few different tracks and a podcast. My first music demo was progressive rock band Porcupine Tree's song "Harridan" from the band's 2022 album _CLOSURE/CONTINUATION._ A groovy and percussive bass line is the first thing you hear, which sounded bold and full-bodied, played through the 65 Flex. A band renowned for layering, after a few bars of bass, drums, and keyboards fill out the rest of the mix, with vocals landing last. When each new layer was introduced, the 65 Flex did an admirable job placing each instrument on the virtual soundstage.

 The last instrument to enter the fold is a crunchy-sounding guitar for the chorus, followed by a big boost in vocals. I've heard this track numerous times with multiple sets of headphones and earbuds, and while my [AirPods Pro 2](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-vivo-v27-pro-by-drfone-android/) do the best job with this song, the 65 Flex was no straggler. That said, the headset reached its volume cap sooner than I would have liked. I tend to play my tunes a little too loudly, so while the 65 Flex's max volume may work for some, I would have enjoyed a few more decibels.

 I always return to Metallica's self-titled album when testing headphones because it's a record that hits hard, is mixed big, and can push the limits of whatever audio device I'm testing. Thus, I went with a little "Holier Than Thou" for my run with the 65 Flex. The song's main chugging guitar riff and fast, anthemic drumming are relentless and kinetic, and the headset did a fantastic job of highlighting the tune's rhythmic backbone. And whenever singer James Hetfield starts belting out his lyrics, the vocalist's center-stage presence was given proper attention.

 Voice-only media sounded pretty great, too. I'm a regular listener of _WTF with Marc Maron_ and have always been a fan of how the show is mixed. Conducting an interview with actor Tim Blake Nelson, both Maron and his guest sounded clear throughout the entire chat. Even when the host would dip into one of his typical laughing bouts, the 65 Flex delivered the sudden gut-busting nearly distortion-free.

 The Evolve2 65 Flex uses Jabra's ClearVoice Microphone Technology, which helps to isolate your voice when taking a phone call while cutting down on any chatter and other ambient sounds around you. I used the 65 Flex outside on a windy day, and when I wasn't facing the breeze head-on, my buddy on the phone said my voice sounded crisp and clear. Unfortunately, I've found that many ANC headsets have trouble with stronger winds, and the 65 Flex was no exception. The moment I would start to hear the breeze pick up, my friend would say he couldn't hear me at all.

 There's also an in-call monitoring feature called Sidetone which allows you to hear an amplified version of your own voice. However, I actually found the monitoring to sound rather choppy, especially when outdoors. Maybe the wind was wreaking havoc on the headset? All I know is that whenever I would start to talk, my voice sounded rather tinny, and the volume level would dip and peak, too. Certain sounds around me would also cut in and out, including things like AC condensers and passing cars. This was especially annoying when these unwanted sounds would cut into the actual call, making it difficult for me to hear my friend at times.

 Similar to the Evolve2 55, the 65 Flex's boom can mute the mic when you flip the boom up into its ear-cup holster. When you want to unmute the mic, simply drop the boom back down.

##  Using the Jabra Direct Software: Robust and Intuitive

Close 

 The Jabra Sound+ app (available for [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jabra-sound/id1320805565) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228088/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jabra.moments&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)) is an incredible companion app that goes hand-in-hand with the Evolve2 Series, but I already wrote about it in my review of the Jabra Evolve2 55\. This time around, I decided to take the desktop software, [Jabra Direct](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228088/https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/jabra-direct) for macOS, for a spin instead, and I'm pleased to report that it's just as robust and intuitive as the mobile app.

 To get things started, you'll first need to connect the Jabra Link 380 (which uses a USB-A connection) to your desktop. I tried connecting the 65 Flex directly using the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable, but this method doesn't work for pairing. Click the "Pairing" tab in the left-hand column of the menu options to sync the 65 Flex with the software. Once you've established the connection, click "Device" to enter the 65 Flex's settings and customizations dashboard. In the "Headset" options, you'll be able to choose which two noise-canceling modes the 65 Flex can cycle between, adjust ANC and HearThrough levels, decide whether or not you want HearThrough to be active when you're playing music, and much more. Clicking "Softphone" will let you play with various in-call and call-answering capabilities.

 The Jabra Direct software will also give you a convenient readout of your headset's battery level, and when the 65 Flex is paired up with the desktop app, the "Updates" tab will ensure your 65 Flex is running the latest firmware.

##  Should You Buy the Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex?

 At $329.99, I think the [Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1DG8CM1?tag=htg-v2-6uhcl7d-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228088&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fjabra-evolve2-65-flex-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a little on the expensive side. Still, if you're looking for a reliable headset for all your workplace needs (especially if you're always using Microsoft Teams), the Evolve2 65 Flex is very comfortable, sounds great, and is simple to personalize. To that end, I would give it a solid one-thumb-up.
