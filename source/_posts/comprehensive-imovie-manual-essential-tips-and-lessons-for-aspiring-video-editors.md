Check the following list below and then edit any video file at liberty. 

* DV Widescreen
* DV
* HDV
* MPEG-4

### #2\. iMovie No Sound Issue 

Similar to the issue of "iMove keeps crashing", "iMovie no sound" error is also caused due to different reasons. Make sure the Project files aren't corrupted and the preferences are right. If both are right, there might be the file codec problem. In this case, you need a [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) software to convert video files to MOV, MP4 or M4V beforehand.

### #3\. iMovie audio is out of sync 

For the best audio/video synchronization in iMovie, the 16-bit sound is recommended with iMovie. In case you import sound with 12-bit audio, please change the settings on your camera before importing your footage. Extract the audio from your footage. Go to the "Edit" menu and click "Select All". Right click to open the dropdown menu, and select “detach audio”. After that, you can sync them up manually.
