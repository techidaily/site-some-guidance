October 01, 2020

During the quarantine, we conducted a global survey among 1600 users of ABBYY [FineScanner](https://go.onelink.me/0oMB/2b084a0a), ABBYY [Business Card Reader](https://go.onelink.me/LuYz/ca107d7), and ABBYY [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/uny1/c9b5ef5c). We wanted to better understand the impact of the quarantine on the way people work.

We learned that 82.1% of respondents switched to a remote work setting during the COVID pandemic.

### Have you been more productive?

Our survey found that 43% of respondents noted they were more productive working from home than in an office, while 32.6% stated that they hadn’t noticed a difference in their level of productivity, and 21.8% claimed that they were less productive. Some respondents shared that they had mixed feeling about working from home.

_“Mixed - more productive some days, less productive other days”_  
_“I tried to be as productive as in my work office. The difference was in the time. I had more often pause, then I had worked later, out of worktime.”_  
_“Depends, some things went better, others worse..”_  
_“Some of each”_ 

### Have you been more motivated?

As for the motivation while working from home, 36.2% of our users haven’t noticed any changes in their motivation level. Nearly the same, 35.4% felt more motivated while working remotely. And 27% of respondents stated that their motivation level dropped.

Compared to pre-COVID, 43.2% of respondents worked longer hours for personal reasons while staying home, and 27.3% worked shorter hours for personal reasons. Here’s what some respondents shared:

_“Longer hours because of dissolution of work boundaries.”_  
_“Working at home while providing full time care has resulted in extremely long work days to complete my workload.”_  
_“I will not say I work more or less compared to when things were normal. However, I have noticed that there are lot of time-wasting activities from other colleagues or superiors which rarely comes up when working from home.”_  
_“Longer hours due to feeling I must perform better under the circumstance of working from home rather than an office building.”_ 

### What is your preferred workplace arrangement when you will be able to return to the office?

Respondents (53%) said that going forward, they would prefer an arrangement that enables flexibility between working from home and working in the office. Many indicated they prefer either splitting their time 50/50 or working mostly from home with some days in the office.

Also, some of our users shared their advantages:

_“Being in the comfort of my home allows me to take a quick break and pet my cats or step outside for fresh air. Having windows open with sounds of nature. No fluorescent lights, no phones ringing, my music as loud as I want. Being able to prep dinner before 5\. Taking a nice walk during my lunch hour. These are a few of my favorite things!”_  
_“Less ineffective communication.”_  
_“More productive not wasting money on petrol and travel time and parking the car once I get to work”_  
_“Better food at home. Possibility to have conf calls while doing simple things around the house like watering plants or enjoying the comforts of my home.”_ 

### …Or disadvantages?

![](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/29713/productivity-6.jpg)What about the disadvantages of remote work? In the survey, 51.4% of respondents stated that there are more distractions at home. The lack of in-person communication with colleagues was a disadvantage for 38.9% of our users, and 29.3% didn’t have a comfortable workstation at home. Here are some less positive thoughts about remote work from our survey participants:

_“The lack of in-person communication, in general, makes it less fun to work from home.”_  
_“I spend longer periods sitting and not moving around every so often.”_
