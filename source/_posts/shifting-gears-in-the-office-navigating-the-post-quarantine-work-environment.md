## The New Normal: How Has the Quarantine Changed the Way You Work?

October 01, 2020

![](https://static2.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/29478/1-productivity.jpg) 

During the quarantine, we conducted a global survey among 1600 users of ABBYY [FineScanner](https://go.onelink.me/0oMB/2b084a0a), ABBYY [Business Card Reader](https://go.onelink.me/LuYz/ca107d7), and ABBYY [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/uny1/c9b5ef5c). We wanted to better understand the impact of the quarantine on the way people work.

We learned that 82.1% of respondents switched to a remote work setting during the COVID pandemic.

Our survey found that 43% of respondents noted they were more productive working from home than in an office, while 32.6% stated that they hadn’t noticed a difference in their level of productivity, and 21.8% claimed that they were less productive. Some respondents shared that they had mixed feeling about working from home.

_“Mixed - more productive some days, less productive other days”_

_“Less ineffective communication.”_  
_“More productive not wasting money on petrol and travel time and parking the car once I get to work”_
