### Why Does Handbrake Enjoy Great Popularity

It cannot be denied that **Handbrake** is one of the most popular free DVD rippers for Mac users, all attributing to its open source and easy-to-use interface. With this free Mac DVD ripper, movies in your DVD collection can be easily liberated from the confines of the plastic-and-metal prison and then you can watch them on your iPhone, iPod, iPad anywhere anytime.

## Have You Ever Pulled Your Hair Out When Using Handbrake 

As we know, there are always two sides to everything and Handbrake is no exception. Troubles can arise in unexpected places:

1\. Handbrake seems powerless when it comes to [rip encrypted DVD movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or commercial DVDs even with the libdvdcss installed or VLC support on Mac, leaving you nothing but errors like no valid source found, handbrake stuck scanning some titles, Handbrake stops encoding halfway, DVD conversion remains incomplete, to just name a few.

2\. In the meantime, this Mac free DVD ripper supports only two output formats: MKV and MP4\. Consequently, if you want to choose AVI or FLV as your final format for uploading to YouTube, you have to turn to other software.

 3\. You'll take a beating about Handbrake's bad compatibility with macOS Big Sur/High Sierra even though it declared that some bugs for running on macOS had been fixed.

4\. To your disappointment, Handbrake delivers a really lengthy DVD video transcoding, reportedly averagely 40 minutes taken to rip a full-length movie. This is generally 2-5x slower compared with other commercial DVD rippers.
