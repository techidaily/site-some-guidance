## 6 Tips for using Zoom on Chromebook

As you press the buttons to zoom in and out, you will see the percent increasing or decreasing on your screen.

### Increase or decrease everything on your screen

### Magnify the entire screen

Using the magnifying glass icon, you can magnify the entire screen. Everything will be the same except that it will zoom in closer. You must press the Ctrl tab with 'M' to invoke the magnifying glass icon and click on 'Continue' if you wish to zoom in on your screen.

### Magnifying part of the screen

One of the unique features of Zoom is that you can magnify a part of the screen. It would be best if you pressed Ctrl plus D on your keyboard. Once you click on 'Continue,' you will see a part of the screen in zoom-in mode. You must remember to hover the cursor in the correct area of your screen that you require in a magnifying manner.

### Increase or decrease the whole screen

* You need to download the Zoom App for Chromebook.
* After you download the Zoom App, you have to create a Google Meet ID
