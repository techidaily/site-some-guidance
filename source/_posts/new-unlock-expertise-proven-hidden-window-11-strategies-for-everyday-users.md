The biggest Windows 11 tip and trick is the placement of Taskbar and Start Menu. Windows 11 has a taskbar and start menu in the center.

The coolest thing about Windows 11 that most people don’t know is the ‘Voice Typing’ feature.

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.
