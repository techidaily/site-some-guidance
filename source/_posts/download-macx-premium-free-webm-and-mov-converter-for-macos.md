## Customer Testimonials

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/webm-video-converter-free/../image/customer-ico.jpg) 

This is a pretty useful video tool to me, especially after I get to find out that I do not have so many choices to play the the videos in the new format WebM. It helps me a lot to convert the comparatively less used WebM video to MP4 so that I can now on my iPod play anytime.

I want to say that this is really a fabulous idea to bring this software to the Mac users like me and help us out when the WebM videos cannot be supported most current media players. It did not take me much time to get the WebM videos converted to MOV and now I could freely watch the video in my QuickTime.
