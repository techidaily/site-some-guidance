## True Color Equalizer

_Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we'll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage._

Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don't have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we're here to help point you in the right direction.

## Part 1\. What is color correction?

Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it's about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.

An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.

* Supports a large number of color effects and filters
* Includes improvements to face lighting, eye focus, and positioning

You can color correct video on Android and iPhone using Snapseed's outstanding filters and special effects, which were developed by Google and are ideal for photo retouching and editing.

For instance, before re-inserting a selected group of exported video frames into your video using a program like Movavi Clips, you can modify them using Snapseed. Instead of creating a social media photo collage movie, you might use it to add distinctive filters and effects to your photographs.

For editing individual video frames or still photographs, Snapseed offers a number of excellent social media-friendly effects.

* You can modify pictures with simple finger swipe sliders without a stylus!
* Free of advertisements. There are no bothersome pop-ups or adverts that interfere with your ability to focus.

Cons

* There is a slight learning process, even though it is considered user-friendly.
* Although there are various videos available to help with learning, it does benefit to have some prior expertise.
* Because the alternatives are not particularly clear, you must be careful to save your work.
* While it is presently possible to integrate with your social network, the possibilities may be more obvious.

**Key Features:**

The standard video editing tools, such as cutting, trimming, and video merging, are available. Using overlays and text graphics, you may also employ animated graphics to make transitions between several video clips. There are additional sound effects and individual music files available.

Adobe Premiere Rush has certain paid features, but once you upgrade, you can make social media-friendly movies with support for up to 4K video output.

Pros

* [Premiere Pro is extremely popular, being included in the Creative Cloud Suite.](https://www.trustradius.com/reviews/adobe-premiere-pro-2018-04-29-00-21-18) So, it has great synergy capabilities. Adobe support is outstanding, and it is the industry standard for the film business.
* Although I appreciate the flexibility I have in Premiere Pro, there are some things that other Adobe tools are superior at. Illustrator is undoubtedly excellent for design.

Cons

* The product needs a fast PC because of the requirements for the video resolution.
