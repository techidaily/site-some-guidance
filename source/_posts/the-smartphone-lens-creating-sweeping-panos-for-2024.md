 When the term 'Panorama' reaches to our ears, majority of people bring those horizontal landscapes in their minds. But what about the beautiful Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty or say a lavish building view? All these tall looking objects will not fit into the traditional horizontal panorama. And here comes vertoramas handy. Vertoramas are basically panorama shots but taken vertically. The **vertical panoramic photos** provide an elevated quality to the tall things of the world ultimately giving them a stunning look and unusual twist.

## Some Beneficial Tips for shooting vertical panorama photo

* Firstly, we would suggest you using a tripod when you need to take **vertical panorama on iPhone** or Android smoothly i.e. to avoid shakiness.
* Choosing a suitable subject becomes a considerable and obvious thing when it comes to vertonama shoot. Therefore, choose a scene which is good enough to be tailored into the panoramic view.
* For better shoot of vertical panorama on Android as well as iPhone, make sure to stand close to the subject to be captured. This way will intensify the tall subjects rather than giving more highlight to the foreground.
* Leaving some space is another beautiful tip especially if you are a graphic designer and want to add some text into the picture. The panorama shot will look perfectly enhanced this way.
