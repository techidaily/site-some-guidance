## The Zoo-Matic Guide to Improved Snapchat Media

Snapchat is an extremely popular instant messaging and social media app where users take instant photos and create short videos. Once you take a photo or video on Snapchat, it is very usual for you to zoom into your photos and videos. You want to make sure that there is nothing wrong in the background or nothing inappropriate is there after editing and applying filters. We will illustrate how to zoom in and out on Snapchat.

## Part 1\. How to Zoom in Photo on Snapchat

More than text messages, people prefer sharing their photos on Snapchat. There is a wide range of trending and popular filters available which you can apply to your photos to make them funny and creative. There are times when you may want to take a zoomed-in photo to highlight only a portion of the entire screen that is coming on your camera frame. Here are the steps on how to zoom in on Snapchat before taking a photo.

Step1Open Snapchat app and tap on Camera icon to take a photo.

## Part 2\. How to Zoom in a Video on Snapchat

## Part 3\. Tips and Tricks for Snapchat Video

Here are certain tips and tricks for Snapchat video that you should keep in mind so that you can make the best out of your Snapchat videos.

**One-Finger Snapchat Zoomed In** – Do you know that you can use a single finger to zoom in and zoom out while shooting a video on Snapchat? All you need to do is slide up the finger to zoom in and slide down to zoom out.

**Hands-Free Recording** – You generally shoot Snapchat video by holding the camera button. Therefore, one hand always stays engaged. However, you can capture Snapchat video hands-free by creative Gesture from Assistive Touch.

Go to Settings> General> Accessibility> Assistive Touch > Create New Gesture. Once the gesture is created, you will see the gesture option the next time you go to shoot Snapchat video and thereafter, go for hands-free video shooting.

**Switch Camera While Recording** – There are times when you may want to shoot with your front camera and rear camera a few moments later. When you shoot Snapchat video, you can switch between the cameras simply by double tap on the screen. For example, if you are shooting with the front camera, you can double tap on the screen to shoot from rear camera now.

**Record Video with External Music –** Snapchat has a wide range of music to add to your videos. However, you may not find the latest ones there. In such a case, if you want to add the latest song to your video, you should play the song on any music app you have. Thereafter, open Snapchat and start shooting the video. The background song from the music app will be recorded in your Snapchat video. All you have to do is time the video perfectly so that the song can sync with your video.

**Send Video Without Any Sound** – If you want to record a short video on Snapchat and send it across to your friends without the audio part or any sound, you can do it instantly. All you need to do is record the video as usual and then tap on the Microphone icon located at the bottom-left corner. Finally, hit the Send button and the video will reach your friend with any sound.

**Add Voice Filter To Your Video** – You can change the voice in your video by adding voice filters. All you need to do is record the Snapchat video as usual. Thereafter, tap on Speaker icon located at the bottom-left corner and you get to select a voice filter to add to your Snap. This is how you can disguise your voice and even distort it if you want to.
