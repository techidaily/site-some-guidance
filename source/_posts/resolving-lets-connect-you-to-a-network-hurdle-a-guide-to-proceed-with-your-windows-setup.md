However, the installation will stall at the "Let's connect you to a network" screen if you lack an internet connection. Fortunately, you can employ a few workarounds to bypass this network setup screen and proceed with your Windows 11 installation.

##  1\. Check Your Connection

 On the "Let's connect you to a network" screen, you'll see the names of available connections. However, if you can't connect to any of them, whether it's Wi-Fi or your wired connection, there's probably a problem with the connection itself.

 To confirm that the problem lies with your Wi-Fi, not your Windows computer, try connecting your smartphone or another device to the Wi-Fi and check if you can access the internet on it. If the internet doesn't work on that device either, then it confirms that the issue resides with your Wi-Fi. The solution, in this case, is to [restart the router](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-centric-ringtone-websites-guide/). You can even contact your ISP for further assistance.

 If you're using a wired connection, make sure the [cable isn't damaged](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-craftsmanship-at-fingertips-discovering-apples-8-excellent-drawing-apps/) and is securely plugged in at both ends. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the cable to see if that helps.

 If all else everthings fails, you can connect your Windows PC to the internet using your mobile hotspot. However, if your mobile hotspot also doesn't display on your Windows network setup screen, then this suggests a deeper problem with your computer's network settings, drivers, or other internal components. You can out some fixes for [common Wi-Fi issues](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flawless-pixel-processor-windowsmac/) to diagnose and resolve the problem.

To achieve this, press Shift+F10 to launch Command Prompt while on the "Let's connect you to a network" screen.

 Your computer will then restart, prompting you to select your region and keyboard layout once more. Afterward, you will arrive at the network setup screen.

However, you can always switch to a Microsoft account later.

##  3\. End the Network Connection Flow Process

 The network connection flow is an essential Windows process that detects and configures network connections on your computer. This process runs during Windows 11 installation and ensures your computer has an internet connection for downloading critical updates.

To do this, press Shift+F10 to launch Command Prompt while on the "Let's connect you to a network" screen.

 In the Command Prompt window, type **taskmgr** and press Enter. This will the [open the Task Manager](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfect-palette-playbook-mastering-the-art-of-grading/) window.
