 Windows 11 requires an active internet connection to download crucial updates and create an account during the installation process. However, the installation will stall at the "Let's connect you to a network" screen if you lack an internet connection. Fortunately, you can employ a few workarounds to bypass this network setup screen and proceed with your Windows 11 installation.

##  1\. Check Your Connection

 On the "Let's connect you to a network" screen, you'll see the names of available connections. However, if you can't connect to any of them, whether it's Wi-Fi or your wired connection, there's probably a problem with the connection itself.

 To confirm that the problem lies with your Wi-Fi, not your Windows computer, try connecting your smartphone or another device to the Wi-Fi and check if you can access the internet on it. If the internet doesn't work on that device either, then it confirms that the issue resides with your Wi-Fi. The solution, in this case, is to [restart the router](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-centric-ringtone-websites-guide/). You can even contact your ISP for further assistance.

 If you're using a wired connection, make sure the [cable isn't damaged](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-craftsmanship-at-fingertips-discovering-apples-8-excellent-drawing-apps/) and is securely plugged in at both ends. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the cable to see if that helps.

 If all else everthings fails, you can connect your Windows PC to the internet using your mobile hotspot. However, if your mobile hotspot also doesn't display on your Windows network setup screen, then this suggests a deeper problem with your computer's network settings, drivers, or other internal components. You can out some fixes for [common Wi-Fi issues](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flawless-pixel-processor-windowsmac/) to diagnose and resolve the problem.

 Since you're currently offline, you'll have to install Windows 11 without an internet connection. After the Windows installation is complete, you'll simply need to [restart your computer](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-15-must-use-hashtags-for-popularity-on-instagram-feed/), and upon restart, Windows will be able to connect with the network drivers again.

To do this, press Shift+F10 to launch Command Prompt while on the "Let's connect you to a network" screen.

 In the Command Prompt window, type **taskmgr** and press Enter. This will the [open the Task Manager](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfect-palette-playbook-mastering-the-art-of-grading/) window.
