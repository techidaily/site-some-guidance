## The Ultimate Guide to Blurring iPhone Pics at Zero Cost

There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones.

04 [Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone

Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models. However, if you are using iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR, you can blur the background of the images only with the people as the main subject.
