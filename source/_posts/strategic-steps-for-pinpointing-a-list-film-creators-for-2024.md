## Where to Find Videographers

### Social Media

Everything you need now can be found on social media, just type in the search button what you are looking for and everything will appear. When used strategically, social media can lead you to quality talent. The film community is a tight knit and social bunch.

On Facebook or Twitter use hashtag to search and monitor conversations surrounding video professionals. Like or follow the pages and accounts that are comprised of video professionals.

If you find an individual or company that seems to fit what you are looking for, check out their pages and look at some of their samples or portfolio. Their page will most likely have short videos across their feed and a link to their website for you to check out more. Look through their reel and some of their full videos while checking of quality and an aesthetic that parallels your wants.

### Personal Recommendation

Word of mouth is often the best route to take when hiring freelancer for a video project. Talk to your colleagues and friends who have hired video professionals, and ask them for recommendations. It can save you a lot of time and effort.

For best results, as with any project you outsource, it is imperative to be very clear about your expectations and your timeline. The right professional will ask a lot of questions up front and deliver result on time.

And let's be honest you can often negotiate a discount price if the person knows their recommendation well. So feel free to go to different people in your network to wind up with to three options, then evaluate the videographers and pick the best one.

So don't be shy to ask a friend, a family or a colleagues if they know someone who is a good videographer that they will recommend to catch your special event.

Sometimes it's better to just get a recommended one since you'll have a hard time looking for it everywhere.

You can always search on google a videographer that is near to you area and for fast transactions you can private message them and always make sure you did a lot of research about them so that you will not waste your time and effort.

These videographers or video companies are putting in the work to make sure their business will come up on the site. When you look at their website, first watch their video reel. This is their version of an elevator pitch. They have a minuet to show you some if their best work to get you to use their services. If they provide quality services, they will have some of their full videos on their website. Watch at least a couple of their full videos will ensure that their video skills are quality. If they don't have any full video on their site, ask them for a reel or consider someone else.

### Freelance Website

![find videographer freelance website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/find-videographer-freelance-website.jpg)

One final option is going on a freelance website to find a videographer. A freelance website works to connect people that aren't looking for permanent hire or short-term business, most likely on some event like weddings. People who work on freelance websites will upload their portfolio and wait for someone like you who needs their services to come along. These most freelancers are college students who studying something about videography or photography. Sometimes the freelancers are those who don't have a company yet or are just starting out in business but they are good in covered such events, you can always ask for proof like, shorts video or a copy of some photos. Not all professional videographer is equal. Each one brings their own experience and artistic eye to a project. There are those that specialize in wedding. Capturing that special day and editing it together in just the right way is a skill set.

An event video captures the essence of an occasions. The memories and moments shared throughout are captures in a way that is not possible with photos alone. When it comes on the costing of the videographer, it is depended on the time spent to the event and the extras to be added on the contract. But if you want to save money you can edit a wedding or birth video to your specification, so you can relive this moment for years to come.
