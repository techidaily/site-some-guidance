## Part 5: What Should I Do if My Podcast Name Is Already Taken?

It can be so annoying to see a podcast name that you brainstormed for taken. Unfortunately, in such a situation, you've got no choice but to start thinking of a new title or to come up with a variation for the name.

Additionally, you can reach out to the initial owner of the podcast name to know whether his/her show is still active. If, fortunately, the show is no longer active, you can discuss with them to remove the podcast name to be able to use it. Some might be willing to sell it to you.
