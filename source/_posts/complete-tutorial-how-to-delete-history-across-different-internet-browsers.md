### Key Takeaways

 Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete to clear your browsing history on a Windows PC, or press Command+Shift+Delete on a Mac. Check your browser's settings to find this option on a mobile device.

 All web browsers remember a list of the web pages you've visited. You can delete this list at any time, clearing your browsing history and erasing the tracks stored on your computer, smartphone, or tablet. Each browser has its own separate history, so you'll need to clear the history in multiple places if you've used more than one browser.

 In the future, you can [use private browsing mode](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-convert-spoken-words-into-text-effortlessly-using-ms-word/) to browse sensitive websites without your browser saving any history. You won't have to clear your history afterward.
