For some of you, there will be an occasion when you need an M4V codec to encode or decode video. For example, you try to play an M4V video in Windows, but only the audio plays, the video does not play, and you may see an error message like "Windows Media Player (or other players) cannot play the file because of the **required video codec**." 

Before you install any M4V codec, you can switch to many other M4V players like VLC Media Player or 5KPlayer that has support for a wide range of codecs including M4V codec, requiring no extra M4V codec. Or you can use a reliable [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that is able to deal with M4V compatibility problem efficiently by converting the M4V file format. We do not recommend you to install M4V codec due to its potential problems such as malware, crashes, unwanted packages or others. If you still think M4V codec is necessary for you, check these most downloaded M4V codec packs.

M4V is supported on Mac. Even though, some users had problems when opening M4V files in QuickTime. An error message says "a required codec isn't available.

Apple developed M4V container format to encode video files in iTunes store. Some M4V files may come with Apple's FairplayPlay copy protection.
