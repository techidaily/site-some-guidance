WebM video can open and play directly in your web browser using HTML5\. As long as the web browser you're using supports HTML5 and WebM (VP9/VP8 codec), you have no need to install any plug-in. Web browsers like Chrome 6, Firefox 4, Opera 10.60, IE 9 (requires WebM MF components) have supported webM video playback long time ago. Only Apple's Safari browser prevents Mac users from smoothly viewing WebM videos on MacBook, iMac or Mac Mini.

After a long time anticipation, eventually, WebM video support has been added in macOS Big Sur 11.3 and later macOS. Thus, you can play WebM (VP9/VP8) on Safari browser without "crying face" any more. Yet, for those whose operating system is macOS Catalina or lower, they're still excluded from this bonus. 

Certainly, you can upgrade Mac to Big Sur to fix this webm playback issue. Or try other Mac webm video players or convert WebM to MP4 from VP9/VP8 to Apple Mac best codec H264/HEVC.
