## Additional Tips for Making Montage Videos on a Mobile Device

Apart from choosing the perfect app for montages, several tricks should also come in handy. Kill boredom and monotonous montages with these tips.

### Use matching elements

Don’t just throw in clips but try to connect them to something similar. Your viewers will have a flow from beginning to end. Nonetheless, use high-quality clips of videos and images to get as clear a montage video as possible on your mobile.

### Work on stability

Remember that your phone is small and light and may not be as stable as compared to other heavy gadgets like cameras. Ensure it is stable when capturing your videos. You can use an adapter clip on a tripod to enhance stability.

### Use the right tool

Ask what you wish to achieve by the end of the editing session. Montage apps come in different capacities. More so, some apps are not compatible with mobile devices. So, check the features and identify the strengths to determine if it’s the right fit for you.

### Shoot in landscape format

It’s better to use landscape instead of portrait format while shooting and editing your video on mobile. This is to avoid the two black vertical bars that occur alongside the edges of your video whenever you shoot in portrait. The landscape will also get a wide clip of coverage.

Closing Thoughts:

How beautiful is it to create stunning montages? But one aspect determines the product. Editing! These 8 montage apps let you do the necessary edits to your video. If you wish to create your video with the Picture In Picture feature, then Power Director should be your choice. Likewise, you can get high-resolution clips with GoPro Quick, LumaFusion, and Filmora Go. Other functionalities like the "A la carte" store where to buy pro features and support for several languages make Filmora Go a hot choice among others.
