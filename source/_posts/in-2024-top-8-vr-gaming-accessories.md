This is not a kind of setup you could have at your home, but it is displayed at exhibitions and other such events.

## 3. Sixense STEM

STEM is one of the kind, it is basically a motion tracking device which is built around the central base station, and is used to monitor the hand’s movement, the head, and movement as well. This platform provides opportunities to the designers to build their around it and provide an experience of a lifetime. It allows us to play many games like baseball in a VR concept.

## 4. Hands Omni

Well, virtual reality is a very vast concept and it provides a very good audio and video experience in the field of virtual reality, but there is a lacking of sense of touch experience. So, designers decided to design a device name Hands Omni which is a glove which lets the user feel the objects that he touches in the game, and it is based on the latest haptic technology. Although the product is in the development stage yet. And the research claim that they have a working prototype ready.
