 AnyDVD, from Slysoft, is a critically acclaimed application that strips copy protection off DVD movies, making DVD discs region-free and unrestricted. However, this DVD ripping software simply works as a background driver using the Window's operating system tray. As a result, to make AnyDVD run on Mac computer is a time wasting as you will find AnyDVD not working on Mac OS X. In this case, you'd better find an **AnyDVD for Mac alternative** to fulfill your task.

**Updated:** _On Feb 25, 2016, AnyDVD was taken down under pressure from organisations that tried to shut it down. So for PC users, they can go to RedFox page to get AnyDVD or head to [AnyDVD crack](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) version at the risk of getting computer under virus infection, or else, they cannot evey find AnyDVD but needs an alternative to AnyDVD to work on Mac and PC._

## Best RedFox AnyDVD for Mac Alternative to Rip DVD 

Since there is no Mac version in AnyDVD, here I suggest you try [**MacX DVD Ripper Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It is the best alternative to AnyDVD for Mac grounded on the below points:

* Decryption capability: AnyDVD only removes region code and basic copyright protections like CSS, UOP while MacX skirts around all DRM encryption tech, no matter region code, RCE, UOP, CSS, or advanced Sony ARccOS, Disney X-project, etc
* Output Formats: AnyDVD can only copy DVDs to ISO or hard drive while MacX can 1:1 backup DVD to ISO image, hard drive, VOB folder, as well as rip DVDs to   **MP4, MKV, H.264, HEVC, MOV, AVI, iPhone iPad, Android,** etc.
* File Size: The output files created by MacX are generally smaller than those from AnyDVD due to better compression.
* Speed: MacX can improve ripping speed up to 5X faster due to GPU HW encoder, while AnyDVD lacks this feature.

And another primary yet crucial point is that MacX works well with both macOS and Windows PC systems:
