## Steam Prohibits Blockchain-Based Games: Valve's Ban on NFT and Crypto Titles Explained

PC gaming may be an open ecosystem, but Valve sets the rules on Steam. Now, it appears that Valve is banning games with blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency technology from its digital storefront.Related: [What Is a "Blockchain"?](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-playlist-hits-social-medias-1-10-video-winners/)As of October 15, 2021, Valve lists "Applications built on [blockchain technology](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-playlist-hits-social-medias-1-10-video-winners/) that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs" as items you "shouldn't publish on Steam" on an officialÂ [support page](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding) for game developers.We checked on [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20211006042124/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding) for that same support page as of October 6, 2021, and the rule regarding blockchain, NFT, and [cryptocurrency](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-itel-p40plus-phones-by-drfone-android/) isn't there. It's a recent change to Valve's developer documentation.Related: [What Are NFTs? Meet Crypto's Digital Collectibles](https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-echo-effects-implementing-reverb-in-digital-sound-environments-windows-edition/)This policy change came to light whenÂ SpacePirate Games, the developer of Age of RustÂ (a game that offers [NFTs](https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-echo-effects-implementing-reverb-in-digital-sound-environments-windows-edition/)), [tweeted](https://twitter.com/SpacePirate%5Fio/status/1448713803680473089) that Valve would be kicking existing blockchain games off the Steam platform:

 While it sounds like the developer has communicated with Valve regarding NFT-based games on Steam, it looks like Valve has made its decision.Â "While I'm disappointed for Age of Rust being removed, the point is more to the fact that Blockchain games as \[a\] whole are going to be removed. This is \[a\] setback for all," the company said in a follow-up [tweet](https://twitter.com/SpacePirate%5Fio/status/1448713805723099137).

 We've reached out to Valve for comment regarding this policy change, but we hadn't heard back as of publication time. We will update this piece if Valve responds.
