Vimeo is a great video sharing site, which professionals and hobbyists alike can upload, share and play videos. It offers basic account users 500MB of free storage space a week and features with SD and HD videos playback. But uploading unzipped videos to Vimeo could go terribly wrong, especially if you care much about video quality. 

So no matter from the perspective of maximizing the storage space or playing video in high quality smoothly, you need compress video for Vimeo before uploading. In the article below, we will offer some tips and Vimeo video compression and guide you [how to compress video on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and Windows for uploading to Vimeo. 

### Why You Need Shrink Video for Vimeo?

Video compression basically means reducing the video file size by encoding a video with a compression algorithm and allowing it to take up less storage space. To be precise, compressing video is not mandatory, but recommended for a couple of reasons:

**1\. Reduce video size.** If you record a video at full quality, you will get a darn big file. For example, 1 minute of 1080p at 30FPS will take up about 150MB for H264\. If you upload it directly to Vimeo, you can run out of the Vimeo free storage space quickly. 

**2\. Reduce mobile data usage and save bandwidth.** Bandwidth is the uploader's connection speed to the Internet. As you 're trying to upload a large video file, it will consume much bandwidth than a smaller video. Still, you need to make sure you have a good Internet connection when uploading video to Vimeo. 

**3\. Video specs approved by Vimeo.** Yes, Vimeo accepts a huge list of supported formats, codecs, resolutions etc., but if you just shot a video, you're foremost suggested to convert and transcode it to smaller size formats like WMV, MP4, FLV in SD or 720p resolution. According to the [Vimeo compression guidelines](https://vimeo.com/help/compression), you'd better shrink your video on the basis of following specs. 

* Format: All major video formats like MP4, 3GPP, AVI, FLV, MPEG-4, MOV, WebM, WMV etc.
* Codecs: Accept most major codecs, but for best results H.264, Apple ProRes 422 (HQ), H.265 (HEVC) are recommended.
* Frame rate: It's best to maintain the video's native frame rate when zipping video, but 23.98fps, 24fps, 29.97fps, 30fps, 60fps are commonly used.
* Bit rate: 2-5Mbps for SD, 5-10Mbps for 720p, 10-20Mbps for 1080p, 20-30Mbps for 2K, 30-60Mbps for 4K and 50-80Mbps for 8K.
* Resolution: A wide range of resolution supported, such as 640×480, 1280×720, 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160, 4096×2160, 8192×4320 etc.
* Audio: Stereo channels, AAC-LC (Advanced Audio Codec) codec, 320 kbit/s data rate, 48kHz sample rate.
* Video Size: 500MB per week for Basic account, 5GB a week for Vimeo Plus members, and 50GB for Vimeo Pro account per week.
