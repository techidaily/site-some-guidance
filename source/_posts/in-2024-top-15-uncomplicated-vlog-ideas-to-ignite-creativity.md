#### 1.String a 5X5 Vignette

You can join 5 clips that are 5 seconds long to create a 5X5 vignette. These vignettes generally have a theme and therefore you can customize them to match your blog.

You can design your 5X5 Vignette – like the one below - using the 5X5 Vimeo Channel. This YouTube video shows a girl is playing snooker.

#### 2.Interview

With this type of video, both you and your interviewee can benefit from increased viewership and attract links. The video is particularly advantageous in improving your rankings on search engines. Just one caveat; make sure you choose a topic that is relevant to your viewers as well as your interviewee’s audiences.

Hope you enjoy and learn from the video below where Marie Forleo interviews Rachel Hanfling on how to simplify any message. Like Marie, you can call experts from specific fields and interview them to get their advice on the queries posed by your viewers.

#### 3.Teach using a "How to" Video

Demonstrating, almost anything, using a “How to” video is a great way to teach a process by breaking it into a step-by-step protocol. The video ideally, has close-up shots while the person performs a particular task for his viewers.

BBC Good Food nails the “how-to” video concept. It has devoted an entire tab for "how-to" tutorials that have a range of videos from buying raw materials – the best meat in the market – to making delicious recipes.

#### 4.Shoot a candid video prank

Let’s say today is April fool’s day. You can choose to upload a video prank. All you need is a victim and a camera that shoots all the events candidly. If you are a team that is hosting the blog, you can plot a prank on a fellow crew member. Such a video improves the fun quotient as well as entertains your audience. Let your viewers enjoy a good laugh.

Check out these adorable kids as they perform a video prank – Just for laughs!

#### 5.Tutor with the screencast

You can also upload a modified version of the "how-to" tutorial called the screencast. Essentially, a screencast projects your computer screen in the form of a video so that you can train your audience to acquire a particular skill – for example you may teach people how to edit photos using Photoshop.

In the following video, Tyler Moore demonstrates ‘how to start your own blog’ by performing the exercise on screen.

#### 6.Shoot a documentary

Shooting a documentary is perhaps the best option for a travel blog or a foodie, road trip. Your viewer can actually picture the culture, food, people and terrain; thus, get a feel of a new destination.

So you think this type of video is suitable for your blog; watch the following video that features the travel vlogger himself - Brain Cox. He has traveled across 30 countries and enjoys shooting videos of his experiences as he travels the world.

#### 7.Upload rare events

Video coverage of rare natural events can be posted if you have a handy camera at that moment. For example, if your blog funds a charity that supports people affected by a disaster; you can post videos to show the intensity of damage caused so that philanthropists understand the need of the hour and donate.

For example, the video below shows clips that film an approaching tsunami. National geographic has benefited from these videos because someone was fortunate enough to have a camera while it struck, thought of recording it and lived to tell the tale.

#### 8.Just Talk

This is by far the most common type of video that bloggers upload. You just need your webcam, the time and a topic that you have insights about. This type of vlog is jokingly referred to as the “video rant” – the blogger appears to vent out his frustrations while delivering his insights on the subject.

Here’s an example of this kind of video. Charles Reeves gained popularity for his blog “Father Apprentice”, where he shares his experiences with new dads so they can enjoy parenthood to the fullest. Check this video, to watch him cater advice to his viewers as he drives.

#### 9.Cover an event

If an event that is happening is relevant to your blog, you can capture it live and upload it for your audience, so they can watch it from the comfort of their home - at their convenience. This blog posts videos of Bill Murray caught on camera. Watch him performing karaoke at Murray Bros Caddyshack restaurant in Florida in the video below.

#### 10.Create a karaoke video

YouTube has a huge list of free karaoke videos for their audience. Likewise, you can create karaoke videos of bestsellers and group them according to different genres. This lets you ranks higher among search engines, because people searching for the songs may land on your website. Also, it will let your viewer’s browse from the list, call friends over and party!

Here’s an example of a karaoke video published on the Dailymotion website.

Now, you have it - 10 simple video ideas. Happy vlogging!
