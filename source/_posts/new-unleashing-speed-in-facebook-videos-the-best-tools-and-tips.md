## Part III. Different Third-Party App Solutions to Speed Videos on Facebook

While the previous options we discussed work favorably in changing **Facebook video playback speed**, they are suitable for specific operating systems. So, you have to download and use them on your device separately.

In this context, using third-party software is a better alternative. It is possible to download and use these apps on any device, like a smartphone or desktop. They are also suitable for operating systems like Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. The available features are extensive, and you can use many functions instead of the basic speed change steps.

However, they are slightly complex to understand for total beginners. You have to use separate apps to download the video from Facebook and then do speed adjustments on another. Both phases are explained here for you to appropriately carry out the process.

### Download the Facebook Video- Using [SnapSave](https://snapsaveapp.com/)

SnapSave is a useful tool you can use to download the video you want to change the video speed of from Facebook. You can use this app to get the videos from the Facebook app, by its URL, or through the browser, you open the app on.

### How to use SnapSave to download Facebook videos?

Next, you can make adjustments to the speed of the video you download offline using Wondershare Filmora. The software is accessible on desktop, in both Mac and Windows devices. Here, you will find many editing functions and features to optimize the quality and look of the videos.

For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon > Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.

There are 6 preset templates available for keyframe-based speed adjustment on this software. You can choose one of the pre-made speed ramp options or customize your personalized speed ramping effect, controlling the keyframes. Adjust the audio pitch as well.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII) to better understand how the speed adjustment and editing process work on Filmora.

## Conclusion

Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.

Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.
