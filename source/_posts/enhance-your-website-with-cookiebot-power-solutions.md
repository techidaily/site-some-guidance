## ABBYY x Arsenal Women: Let’s Get Real with Alessia Russo, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Emily Fox

July 5, 2024

ABBYY has been a proud member of the Arsenal family since 2023, when we became the Official Intelligent Automation Partner of Arsenal Women Football Club.

Through this partnership rooted in game-changing innovation and commitment to excellence, ABBYY and Arsenal have collaborated on exciting initiatives such as [hosting the ABBYY AI Summit at the iconic Emirates Stadium](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and publishing the [Let’s Get Real content series](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) to give Arsenal Women fans an exclusive glimpse into the personalities of their favorite players.

Fans’ responses to Let’s Get Real were electric, demonstrating great enthusiasm for the chance to hear players’ favorite memories, defining moments, and even their thoughts on artificial intelligence. 

ABBYY and Arsenal Women are now excited to present this extended installment of Let’s Get Real, featuring Alessia Russo, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Emily Fox.

##### Up Close and Personal 

This fan-favorite segment explores the people, moments, and memories that have defined the journeys of Alessia, Kyra and Emily - both on and off the pitch. From the smell of home cooked meals before training to the indescribable experience of playing in the Women’s World Cup, the Gunners share anecdotes that paint an insightful picture of their paths from pickup games with the neighborhood boys to packing the stands of Emirates Stadium. 

As a bonus, hear the trio’s relatable wish list of tasks they’d delegate to artificial intelligence.

_“Cook and clean. Yeah, I hate cooking.”_  – **Kyra Cooney-Cross** 

##### Game-Changing Moments 

_“I think a game-changing moment can come from anyone on the pitch, can happen at any time in the game – it’s just a part of football. Someone has to step up at the right moment, and we have players all over the pitch that can do that.”_ – **Alessia Russo** 

Relive three intense matches that the Gunners recollect as having definitively game-changing moments, including a perfectly executed team goal in a tight match against Everton and a setup for a well-placed penalty kick taken by Arsenal legend Kim Little for a win on Manchester United. 

Perhaps the most special was the North London Derby against rival club Tottenham, where Beth Mead assisted Alessia for an electric goal in front of a record-breaking crowd of 60 thousand at Emirates Stadium. 

_“The atmosphere of a North London Derby – regardless of where it is – is high, and when you’re playing it at the Emirates in front of all our fans and family and friends is so special.”_ – **Alessia Russo** 

##### This or That? 

This or That gives some lighthearted perspective into a variety of the players’ preferences: Past or future? Enjoy a hike or a break in the city? First on the dance floor, or first on the mic? 

_“Neither.”_ – **Alessia and Kyra** 

ABBYY is grateful and excited about the opportunity to continue collaborating with Arsenal Women to bring fans closer to the game and its players, as well as the pursuit of excellence and innovation. 

While AI innovation might not always entail cooking or preparing pre-match hair for Arsenal Women players, ABBYY is pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence in business to improve professional experiences for global enterprises. 

Leaders of these global enterprises dove deep into how ABBYY transforms business-critical workflows at the ABBYY AI Summit, held in Arsenal’s own Emirates Stadium.
