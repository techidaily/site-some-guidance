## Part 1: What is HDR Photography?

HDR photography enables you to capture a photo with a greater dynamic range. This technique helps you incorporate a higher ratio of ligh to dark contrast to your images.

As a photographer, you might have noticed the white often wash out the highlights. Or, dark colors appear big and black blobs. And it’s quite challenging to maintain both factors while clicking a stunning photo.

But this is not the case with HDR photography.When you opt for it, it lets you capture photographs with amazing details. It even allows you to merge several exposures, so you can showcase details with darker and brighter tones, even in high-contrast scenario.

Does it all sound interesting? If so, let’s check some HDR cameras.

## Part 3: How to Set Up your Camera for HDR Shooting

Following steps will help you start shooting with your HDR camera.

##### Step1 Decide on Camera Mode

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![camera mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-6.jpg)

Most photographers prefer aperture priority mode. One reason is that you decide on the aperture and allow you camera to decide on the shutter speed, considering metering mode.

##### Step2 Metering Mode

![metering modes of camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-7.jpg)

You’ll need to decide between the evaluative/matrix (scene-based), center wieghted or spot metering modes. Choosing one entirely based on your preferences.

However, evaluative/scene-based metering mode is seen as the reliable mode in aperture priority. Because, this mode will balance and find median exposure on the given scene.

##### Step3 Aperture, ISO and Shutter

![iso](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-8.jpg)

For landscape or cityscape, an ISO of 100 is considered the best. Even in low light situation, this setting works.

A small aperture of about f/8 to f/22 is enough. However, you need to check the level of lens sharpness to get balanced photos.

Shutter speed translates to the estimated time the sensor exposes to the scene, the longer the shutter speed, the brighter your photo will be.

**Bonus Tip:**

Go for raw shooting, as raw files keep record information on the given image sensor.

##### Step4 Automatic Exposure Bracketing

![aeb setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-9.jpg)

If you’re using a DSLR/mirrorless camera, it’ll have AEB. To enable it, go to menu. You should go through the manual, as every camera has accessed the feature differently.

Once found, it’ll make you set two things; interval and bracket. Brackets will decide on the number of photos you’ll capture whereas interval keeps the gap between those photos.

##### Step5 Timer and Mirror

You can focus on these steps to reduce slightest movement, even if your camera is mounted on the tripod.

**Timer**

![timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-10.jpg)

A two-second timer sounds great as it’ll prevent you from coming in contact with your gear and avoid even the least chance of movement.

**Mirror Lockup**

![mirror lockup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-11.jpg)

A risk of micro-vibration is present in DSLRs, especially when the mirror flips up and expose the image sensor to the light. You can use lockup feature to fix this.

Press the shutter release once, as it’ll flip up the mirror. Press is second time to open the shutter curtain and capture the photo.

##### Step6 Go for One or More Bracketed Exposures

Now you’re good to click snaps! Just press the shutter release button and listen to the sound of shutter curtains.

Lastly, go to histogram on the LCD screen and ensure each photo features the full dynamic range.

In post processing, you can opt for more than one bracketed exposures, so choose the best ones.
