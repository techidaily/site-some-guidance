### Social Networking

So, you are scrolling through your home feed and you see a picture you love, you can hear the picture just like Instagram and also comment. If you love an artist or editor's style/technique you can follow the person's account.

The social networking feature is the feature I love the most in PicsArt. You get to interact with people of the same interest (creating beautiful photos and artwork). If you also plan on building a career in photo editing and digital arts, this feature will be really helpful. People can see your work and appreciate it by following you. You may also get a job recommendation.
