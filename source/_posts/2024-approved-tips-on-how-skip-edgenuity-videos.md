### Features on Filmora Teachers Could Use to Improve Educational Videos

Text-to-speech technology lets machines read text aloud with natural-sounding voices. Educators can use this to add narration to educational videos. That helps explain the lessons better.

Type a narration and add it to the parts of the video where they are needed. Then, use text-to-speech.

**Screen Recorder**

The screen recorder feature is handy for lessons that need a lot of explaining or demonstration. It will let you convert the Paint app or another app into a digital whiteboard.

**Split Screen**

You can utilize the split screen feature when teaching the differences between things. Use one screen to show one of the subjects and one for the thing you are comparing it with.
