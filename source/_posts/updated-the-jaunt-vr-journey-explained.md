## Who is working with Jaunt?

 Learn the partnership of Jaunt VR Company with different brands.

 Since then and until now, Jaunt’s VR technology can be considered highly successful. Its partnership with different brands made this success a real thing. Jaunt primarily collaborated with Paul McCartney in 2014, who is part of The Beatles. Together, they built a 360-degree complete immersive concert experience, giving users a VR head mounted device. This is now available on Google Play for fast installation.

 Later, Jaunt worked with The Northface and introduced a project popularly known as “The Northface VR”. Also, they have created 360-degree videos into the wild in the Yosemite National Park located in California, with mountaineers clinging on the rock edge and cliff. Earlier in 2015, you have witnessed how aggressive Jaunt VR was to offer the best possible virtual reality experience.

 The story doesn’t end here because Jaunt also teamed up with director Paul Feig to make a VR experience project. They called it “Other Space”. It was released in April 2015, displaying at SXSW. The project took place in the Moab (Utah) and Yosemite National Park (California), which featured athletes Same Elias and Cedar Wright.

 Remember the concert of Big Sean happened at Highland Center of Hollywood? His track “Blessing” was improved by the VR technology of Jaunt. This enabled viewers to experience like they were really in the front row of the audience.

 We can expect more about the VR innovation of Jaunt. Music lovers and even outdoor athletes can now take advantage of its technology. People can see Jaunt VR Company collaborating with other giant industries in the near future.
