Converting M2TS to MKV format can be beneficial in plain sight. Firstly, a full movie in .m2ts takes a lot of memory storage, with a file size ranging from 40 to 50GB. But the M2TS file will be shrunk to 10GB when converted to MKV format partially because it keeps the desired part but removes the redundant tracks. This is especially desirable if you want to **save more space**. In the meantime, AVCHD camcorders from Sony, Panasonic, Canon and more store recordings in .m2ts, which is troublesome if you need to upload these shootings to YouTube or other sites. But to convert M2TS to MKV format will **ensure a fast uploading**. Last but not least, MKV manages to keep the video and audio tracks, subtitles and menu of M2TS file ripped off from Blu-ray Disc into a single file without discarding any part, **a perfect companion for movie backup**.
