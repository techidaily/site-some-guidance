The following section of this article will share Windows 11 tips and tricks with you that are hidden and secret.

### 1\. Turn off the Notifications

With the increased number of notifications in Windows 11, you might get annoyed. For that, you can turn off the notifications from the 'Settings.' Either you can go to the settings from the Start Menu or by pressing 'Win+I.' Then, head over to ‘System’ and hit 'Notifications.'

### 2\. Minimize Applications

Minimizing Applications allows you to minimize the extra tabs as a whole rather than doing it individually. You have to hold the tab that you are using by left-clicking and shaking it. It will minimize all extra tabs. The same process can be done to restore the minimized windows.

This feature can be activated through Windows Settings and then by clicking on ‘Multi-Tasking.' Switch on the toggle switch next to ‘Title Bar Window Shake,' and it is ready to use.

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.

However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar' or 'Taskbar Items. '

![disable widgets and other items](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-7.jpg)
