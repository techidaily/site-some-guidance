**Download:** you can download the app from [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster/id1223932558).

**Price:** One of the best advantages of KineMaster is that it is available in free and paid versions for its users, but the question arises here. What is the difference between them? Let us tell you if you are using its free version. There are a few restrictions like you cannot access highly advanced editing tools, popular filters, effects, stickers, etc. The biggest con among them is they will put their watermark on your videos, which may affect their looks.

Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.
