OS X, also macOS, is the Unix-based graphical interface operating system developed by Apple Inc. to exclusively power every Mac computer. It's engineered to make the utmost of what the hardware is capable of and to deliver the most intuitive and comprehensive computer experience in the world.

Mac OS X, X on behalf of the Roman numeral for 10, was the successor to Mac OS 9 (released in 1999) and its first version released was Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, followed with Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah" in 2001\. Former releases of OS X were named after big cats, such as OS X v10.8 referred to as "Mountain Lion".
