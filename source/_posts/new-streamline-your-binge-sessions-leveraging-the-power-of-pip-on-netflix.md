## Streamline Your Binge Sessions: Leveraging the Power of PIP on Netflix

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps. You can now bake a cake or iron your clothes while watching something on **Netflix**. But did you know that you can also do this kind of multitasking on your device? Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

Android users have long enjoyed the use of a floating window on their devices. And now, this function is available for iOS users as well. The picture-in-picture function involves a floating window that can be resized and moved across the screen. You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

### PiP on Mac

Mac differs from Windows in the sense that it doesn't have an actual app for Netflix. Instead, you can watch your videos by using the web browser.

The picture-in-picture feature is available if you are using the Google Chrome browser. If you're using a Linux or Windows computer, you can also work with the following method.

1. First, launch **Google Chrome** on your device.
1. Open [**com**](https://www.netflix.com/) and select a movie or show.
1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.

Your video will now appear through a floating window. This window can be resized and freely dragged around the screen. You can now do other tasks with your device while you enjoy your Netflix show.

### PiP on Windows

Using the picture-in-picture feature on Windows is simpler than on other PC devices. If you have a device with a **Windows 10** version or higher, you can activate your floating window with only a few easy steps.

1. The first step is to open the **Netflix app** which is available for Windows 10 users and higher.
1. **Play** a video from the app.
1. The **PiP** **button** is displayed at the bottom right corner. Simply click the button to transfer your video to a floating window.

If the following methods don't work, you can disable and enable the settings again or consider restarting the phone.
