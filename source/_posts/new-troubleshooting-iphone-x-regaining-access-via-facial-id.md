* If your face doesn't match five times
* Once you power off or click emergency SOS by holding and pressing the volume control and side button instantaneously for 2 seconds
* If you iPhone X charge is 10% or below

![reset face id](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reset-face-id-iphone-x.jpg)

#### Restarting iPhone X

Another option is restarting your iPhone X, while your face id for iPhone X is not working. Many users try rebooting the iPhone option by holding the volume and side button and then drag to slide the power off. Then, press the power button to reboot your iPhone. If this process of rebooting doesn't work, then try the force rebooting option by pressing the volume up button first, releasing it, and then again follow the same with the volume down button and releasing it.

#### Make sure you are Directly Facing TrueDepth

Are you sure your iPhone X is in a portrait angle? It is very important to ensure while using iPhone X that your face is directed towards the TrueDepth camera, and it's in portrait orientation. The true depth cam has the same view range as while taking selfies or while making facetime calls. Your iPhone X must be within an arm's length from your face while unlocking with face id. If you are out with your iPhone on broad daylight, make sure that the sun is not just behind you.
