## Introducing the Elegant, Space-Saving EV5 – Kia’s Latest Electrifying Crossover Compact SUV

KIA has officially unveiled the compact EV5 all-electric SUV earlier than many expected. This model builds on the success and overall styling of the bigger [three-row EV9](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/how-can-i-add-the-latest-toshiba-printer-drivers-to-my-windows-pc/) from earlier this year and is positioned as an alternative to those looking for a slightly smaller, family-friendly EV.

 We first saw the concept EV5 in March, and surprisingly, the official production model kept the same overall look. It's big and boxy, and features a uniquely bold design compared to most vehicles on the road. At the Chengdu Motor Show in China, Kia said its new EV5 "brings a new era of electric mobility to the compact SUV sector to meet the needs of millennial families."

 Unfortunately, all we're getting today is the announcement and several exciting photos showing off its good looks. The automaker didn't share any specs or range estimates, but we're assuming it'll be similar to other vehicles from the company. For example, the EV6 sports a single or dual-motor option powered by a 77kWh battery pack, delivering plenty of power and range. It'll likely use the same E-GMP platform with 800V fast charging, vehicle-to-grid or V2V options, and be loaded with fancy features inside and out.

 As expected, one area that did change from concept to production is the interior. The inside is comfortable, cute, and spacious, with a slew of mood lighting strips owners can adjust between 0-10 brightness. You'll get a sizeable dual-screen infotainment system, a large moon roof, and an overall elegant design. Throughout Kia's press release, the company mentions millennials and how much of the design is geared towards those buyers. As a result, the interior is comfortable and closer to a living room than a traditional car.

 Again, we don't have too many details on trim levels or additional options, but it'll come in nine different glossy finishes or an optional matte silver. Some earlier reports suggested a slightly larger battery than the EV 6 crossover and a price tag lower than the Tesla Model Y, so we'll have to wait and see.

 Kia confirmed more information will arrive in the coming months before its release in China later this year. Then, considering this is a global model, expect a similar offering stateside in early 2024.
