DVD to Facebook

Here are mainly 3 reasons you need to convert DVD to Facebook beforehand:

* The physical DVD format is MPEG-2, which is excluded from [Facebook supported video format list](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
* The size of a general DVD file ranges from 4.7GB to 9.4GB, which greatly exceeds the Facebook video upload limit, up to 1 gigabyte in size. So you need to resize and shrink your DVD video into less than 1 GB before uploading DVD to Facebook.
* The max length of the video you can upload to Facebook is 45 minutes. Make sure to convert you DVD and cut it down within the length before uploading.
