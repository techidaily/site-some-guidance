Handbrake will not rip DVDs or skip bad sectors on Windows 10/11 or macOS 14 Sonoma, according to both Mac and Windows users. The primary reason is the lack of libdvdcss that Handbrake uses to rip encrypted DVDs or the Handbrake libdvdcss version doesn't work anymore.

## Part 1: Install Handbrake Libdvdcss 64-Bit on Windows (10/11)

The 32-bit VLC will no longer work if you upgrade your Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit. Then you can't use the libdvdcss in VLC to help Handbrake [rip protected DVDs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). To solve this Handbrake libdvdcss error, you can download the latest VLC in 64-bit.

 If you see the error message "Handbrake could not find VLC or your VLC is incompatible" (Note: 32-bit vlc is not compatible with 64-bit HandBrake and vice-versa), it is because VLC 2.x changes the code library libdvdcss. Then you need to manually download the Handbrake libdvdcss-2.dll on Windows 11/10\. The detailed guide on how to download libdvdcss-2.dll for Handbrake on Windows is as follows:

## Part 2: How to Download/Install Handbrake Libdvdcss on Mac without Error 

To avoid legal issues, Handbrake deliberately removes the installation of libdvdcss. Downloading the libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac is a little bit complicated on macOS later than El Capitan because of its SIP (System Integrity Protection). The SIP in macOS 14 Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, etc. removes some apps, making Handbrake libdvdcss.2.dylib or libdvdcss pkg file not work on Mac. 

###  Option 1: Steps to Install Handbrake libdvdcss on macOS via Homebrew 

To install libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac, the easiest way is using Homebrew. SO you need to download Homebrew on Mac first. It gives you access to hundreds of open source packages that Apple didn't allow. Homebrew also works on M1 Apple Silicon machines so you can install libdvdcss for Handbrake on M1/M2 Macs using Homebrew. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then open Terminal.

Step 2: Type in /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

 Step 3: Hit Return and enter your password. Hit the return key on your keyboard to continue.

 Step 4: Wait for the installer to begin and finish downloading. 

Step 5: Start Terminal.

 Step 6: Enter "brew install libdvdcss" and hit Enter. It will automatically download and install libdvdcsss for Handbrake on Mac.

###  Option 2: Steps to Manually Install Handbrake libdvdcss on macOS 

 While Homebrew is the easiest method to download libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac, if you don't want to get libdvdcss for Handbrake using Homebrew for any reason, we also share two other methods to manually install Handbrake Libdvdcss on Mac 14 Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur...

**Method 1:** 

To resolve libdvdcss Handbrake Mac issues, manually download Handbrake libdvdcss on Mac: 

Step 1: Download and install Handbrake libdvdcss.pkg on Mac at 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/download-icon-step.png) <https://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/1.4.2/macosx/libdvdcss-1.4.2.pkg>

 Step 2: Then run this command in a Terminal window to install the libdvdcss libdvdcss.2.dylib for Handbrake:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/  
_sudo cp \~/Downloads/_libdvdcss\_1.4.2/libdvdcss.2.dylib /usr/local/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib

![Download the latest macOS libdvdcss for Handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/libdvdcss-download.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 **Method 2:** 

Hvyboots, a Reddit user, shares a solution for this Handbrake libdvdcss error by installing a copy of Handbrake libdvdcss.2.dylib on Mac. 

Step 1: Create a new Finder window.

Step 2: Type cmd+shift+G, and paste in this path: /Library/SystemMigration/History/. Then go to Migration-some-gibberish/QuarantineRoot/usr.

Step 3: Find and copy libdvdcss.2.dylib file.

 Step 4: Use cmd-shift-G to /usr/local/lib

Step 5: Drag and drop the libdvdcss.2.dylib file into the /usr/local/lib folder to finish the libdvdcss installation on Mac. 

**Note 1:** If you only have a /usr/lib instead of a /usr/local/lib folder, the /usr/lib is probably write protected with SIP. You can just create the directory and then sudo cp into the /usr/local/lib directory:  
  
_sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib_  
  
 Or use the Finder with shift-**⌘-**g and type in /usr/local/lib to open a window to copy the libdvdcss.2.dylib files. Then you should get prompted for a admin account.

**Note 2:**  Handbrake 1.6.1 is not available for Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan or earlier versions. Upgrade to macOS 10.13 or higher before you update Handbrake to the 1.6.1 version. Or stay with your current Handbrake version if an operating system upgrade is not in your plans. 

### Option 3: Get Libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac via VLC

According to Handbrake, HandBrake will dynamically load VLC's copy of libdvdcss if you have it in your Applications folder in macOS systems. So if the above methods to download libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac are too complicated for you, you can install VLC on your computer. Then you should be able to decrypt a protected DVD with Handbrake directly. And the libdvdcss in VLC will work in the background to help Handbrake read an encrypted DVD. 

 _If your downloaded libdvdcss is still not working for Handbrake, or if you have any problem with the above steps, check this more detailed guide on [how to install libdvdcss on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)._

## Part 3: How to Rip Protected DVDs with Handbrake Libdvdcss 

After you download libdvdcss for Handbrake, you can now use Handbrake and libdvdcss to rip protected DVDs on Mac and Windows. Some users are wondering if they **need to configure Handbrake to use libdvdcss** when they handle a protected DVD. The answer is **No**. You don't need to do anything. Handbrake will automatically load the libdvdcss library once it's installed on your Mac or PC. 

### How to rip protected DVDs on Mac/Windows using Handbrake and libdvdcss?

**Step 1:** Insert a DVD into your Mac or PC's optical drive and open Handbrake. Click Open Source or File under Souce Selection, select the DVD and wait a few seconds while the app reads the disc. Handbrake will use the libdvdcss.dll or libdvdcss.pkg on your computer in the background to detect and find the correct title of a protected DVD.

**Step 2:** Open the Preset drop-down menu to choose the quality of your final file. Check the General section, then you can see Very Fast, Fast, HQ, and Super HQ. To rip a DVD, choose 480p or 576p depending on whether the disc is PAL or NTSC. Don't choose larger presets like 720p or 1080p for DVDs - they won't make your video look any better but just make the file bigger.

## Part 4: \[Fix\] Handbrake Libdvdcss can't Rip Protected DVDs from Disney, Paramount... 

However, even with libdvdcss installed on the computer, Handbrake still fails to find the valid title or the output files are pixelated or the like. Why? If Handbrake (with libdvdcss) is not working on your Mac or Windows PC, it's mainly caused by reasons below. 

###  1\. Corrupted libdvdcss file 

Handbrake versions after 0.9.2 won't rip protected DVDs. It needs libdvdcss downloaded and installed to treat copy protections properly. If the libdvdcss download process is interrupted, the downloaded libdvdcss file may be corrupted or incomplete. When your Handbrake libdvdcss stops working, you will have various problems when copying protected DVDs. For example, Handbrake can't read the disc at all, Handbrake keeps crashing or repeats the first few minutes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Wrong libdvdcss version 

If the Handbrake libdvdcss is not working on an M1 Mac, make sure you have downloaded the **correct libdvdcss version.** An **x86 64-bit version of libdvdcss is not compatible with M1 Macs**. Therefore, Handbrake can't use libdvdss when ripping a protected DVD. You have to install an Arm architecture-compatible version of libdvdcss.

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg" border="0">Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

It also allows customisation of ebook HTML via templates and source code documents; and you can create Windows CHM and wxWidgets HTB help files. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Incorrect folder for libdvdcss 

The downloaded libdvdcss for Handbrake should be **stored in the correct folder**, or Handbrake won't be able to load the libdvdcss copy to rip a protected DVD. For example, if you install the libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac M1/M2 machines with the Homebrew method, the libdvdcss.2.dylib will be automatically stored in /opt/homebrew/cellar/libdvdcss/1.4.3/lib. 

This is because Homebrew on M1 Macs installs files into the /opt/homebrew/ folder instead of the /usr/local/ folder. However, it seems that Handbrake can only read libdvdcss from the /usr/local/ folder. So you should manually move the libdvdcss-2.dll file from there to the folder /usr/local/lib.

### 4\. Libdvdcss file is named incorrectly 

Check if your libdvdcss file is named correctly. The process of installing the libdvdcss for Handbrake involves copying and pasting the file to another folder. If the destination Handbrake folder or /usr/local/lib already contains an older libdvdcss file, the copied new libdvdcss will be named as libdvdcss-2(2).dll or the like. You need to rename the new file as libdvdcss-2.dll to fix the Handbrake libdvdcss not working errors.

### 5\. Libdvdcss is not working with Handbrake on Apple Silicon (M1/M2 Macs) 

On an M1/M2 MacBook Air/Pro, you may notice that libdvdcss for Handbrake is not working while it would work fine on an x86 Mac. Luckily, there is a user on Reddit providing a solution for this:

1. Rename /Applications/Handbrake.app as Handbrake-x64.app.
2. Right-click Handbrake-x64.app, select "Get Info", then check the box for "Open using Rosetta"
3. brew uninstall libdvdcss
4. Right-click /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, select "Duplicate", name it Terminal-x64.app
5. Right-click Terminal-x64.app, select "Get Info", then check the box for "Open using Rosetta"
6. Open Terminal-x64.app and run 'arch' and make sure it says 'i386', not 'arm64'
7. cd /tmp
8. curl -OL https://get.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.4.3/libdvdcss-1.4.3.tar.bz2
9. cat libdvdcss-1.4.3.tar.bz2 | bunzip2 | tar x
10. cd libdvdcss-1.4.3
11. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
12. make
13. sudo make install
14. Then libdvdcss should work with Handbrake on your M1/M2 Macs to decrypt DVDs correctly.

### 6\. Advanced encryption measures 

The latest Handbrake version still has **trouble handling tougher copy protections** like 99 titles in DVDs protected by X-project protection (from Disney, Pixar, Paramount, Sony, etc.), even though libdvdcss is installed. This is because libdvdcss is only meant to rip DVDs encrypted with CSS or remove different regions. For DVDs encoded with other types of copy protection such as Disney protection, Sony ARccOS, etc, Handbrake libdvdcss is willing but powerless to handle them. 

**Tips:** A workaround to rip Disney 99-title DVD with Handbrake is to play the DVD in VLC first and remember the main title of the actual movie. Then tell Handbrake the right title. To rip protected titles, you will need a [free Mac DVD ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that supports protections. 

## Fix Handbrake Libdvdcss Issues & Rip All Protected DVDs Easily 

Problems with libdvdcss Handbrake on Mac or Windows can now be resolved as described above. For users who are tired of figuring out how to fix handbrake 64-bit libdvdcss on Windows, how to download handbrake libdvdcss pkg on Mac, or want to rip DVDs protected by Sony ARccOS, Disney X-project, etc, a once-for-all solution is recommended: Handbrake alternative.

[**MacX DVD Ripper Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), for example, frees users from any Handbrake libdvdcss errors, avoids any protection measures, and expands the preset profiles to 350+: 

* Rip any DVD to MP4, H.264, HEVC, MOV, M4V, FLV, MPEG4, AVI, QT, MP3, and iPhone, iPad, Android, PS5/4, Xbox One, Plex server, Roku, NAS, and **350+** popular devices.
* A **built-in DVD decrypter** to bypass DVD CSS, region code, RCE, Sony ArccOS, UOPs, and Disney X-project protections, and more. No VLC libdvdcss or additional software/plug-ins are needed.

## Part 5: Handbrake Libdvdcss FAQ

**How do I download and install libdvdcss for Handbrake on Mac M1/M2?**

On an M1/M2 Mac machine, you can also use the Homebrew method to install libdvdcss for Handbrake. If that doesn't work on your M1/M2 Mac, you can use MacPorts to download the libdvdcss library for Handbrake and then copy the library to /usr/local/lib. Simly unzip the library files in a .zip. and copy them to /usr/local/lib and it should work.

**What is Libdvdcss?** 

Libdvdcss is a library from the VideoLAN project, mainly designed for DVD players like VLC to decode DVDs encrypted with CSS. Libdvdcss can't crack the DVD player key to let it play a protected DVD, instead, it will generate a set of calculated player keys and try them until it hits on the right one. If the drive does not recognize any of the player keys, it will launch a brute force search of the very limited key space. With libdvdcss, Handbrake can handle some copy protections like CSS and region code. 

**Where can I get Libdvdcss?**

If you want to download libdvdcss.dll or libdvdcss.pkg for Handbrake manually, you can find it on Git or the official site of VideoLan. Search libdvdcss in Google > get into the libdvdcss page on the site of VideoLAN > find Get libdvdcss section and click the orange "releases". Then you can scroll the list and download the right version of libdvdcss for Handbrake on Windows and Mac. 

**Is libdvdcss legal to install?** 

Libdvdcss as a way to decrypt DVD is authorized by a French law decision CE 10e et 9e sous­sect., 16 juillet 2008, n° 301843 on interoperability. Whether it is legal in the USA or other countries, you need to check out their copyright laws. 

**Is libdvdcss included in VLC?**

Yes. libdvdcss is part of the VideoLAN project and the VLC media player uses it to play content with CSS. That means if you have installed VLC on your Windows or Mac, you don't need to manually install libdvdcss for Handbrake anymore. Handbrake and VLC libdvdcss will work together automatically when you rip an encrypted DVD. 

**How do I use libdvdcss with Handbrake?**

You don't need to do anything to get libdvdcss to work. Handbrake will dynamically load libdvdcss if you choose to decrypt a DVD. 

**How to install libdvdcss for Handbrake on Linux?**

To download libdvdcss for Handbrake on Linux, you can follow these steps:

Step 1\. Open a terminal window.

Step 2\. Add the Handbrake PPA (Personal Package Archive) to your system by running the following command:  
_sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases_

Step 3\. Update your package lists by running:  
_sudo apt-get update_

Step 4\. Install Handbrake and libdvdcss by running:
