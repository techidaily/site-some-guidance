Why needs to split videos? One, you don't need the whole video, just parts of it. Two, the file size of the entire video is too large, beyond your device space capacity. Third, the larger in size, the lower in speed. As for the video streaming, transferring or saving to mobile device, hard drive or SD card, the whole video transferring might waste your precious time up to several or dozens of hours. Thus, these are the reasons why you need a video splitter software to split a whole video to seperate parts.

There are a ton of video splitters offering a way to cut video without quality guaranteed, meaning that it is a needle-in-a-haystack task to dig out the greatest one. I pick out two wonderful tools here for your reference, one is a well-known **video splitter freeware** \-VLC, another is a simple yet powerful video editor that embraces a wide range of stunning features, **[MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)**. 

## How to Cut Video with VLC ?

**VLC** is known as a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player that also works with video clip. To trim video, first, launch [VLC media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and open your video file. Second, click "view" button at the top and select Advance Controls. Third, move the slider of the process bar to locate the start position and press the red record button. Then, click the play button, wait for the video playing to the end point you want to split, remember to press the record button again. This free video editing software delivers good output video quality. However, you should keep the video playing while splitting, which takes you more time to finish the task. On the other hand, precision in clipping video and output quality remains to be improved.
