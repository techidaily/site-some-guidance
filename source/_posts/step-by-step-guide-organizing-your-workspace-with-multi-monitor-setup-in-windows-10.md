##  How to Rearrange Your Displays

 To set up the arrangement of your monitors, you'll need to head to the Display settings page. To quickly access it, right-click on Windows 10's desktop and select "Display settings."

 Alternately, you can open the Settings app by pressing Windows+i. Navigate to System > Display.

 If you have more than one monitor hooked up, you will see a visual representation of the monitors as rectangles with numbers inside them. This simplified diagram represents the orientation of your monitors as Windows understands it. To change it, we need to change the diagram.

 To reposition a display, click on its rectangle and drag where you want it in relation to the other monitors you connected.

 If your displays have different resolutions, then the rectangles will be different sizes. It is useful to align the tops or bottoms of the two displays so the mouse cursor and windows you drag will move between them as you would expect. To do that, simply click and drag one of the monitor boxes until the top or bottom sides line up.

##  How to Change the Primary Monitor (Main Display)

 In Windows 10, the "primary monitor" or "main display" is the monitor on which new windows and apps open up by default. You can change which monitor is the primary display from the same Settings > System > Display screen.

 In Display settings, click on the rectangle representing the monitor that you want to designate the primary monitor in Display settings. Windows will highlight the box representing the selected monitor.
