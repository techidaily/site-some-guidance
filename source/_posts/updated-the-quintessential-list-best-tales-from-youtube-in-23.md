![ted talk on storytelling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/popular-youtube-storytelling-channels-2.jpg)

_**Subscriber Count: <17 million**_

TED or TED conference is a YouTube channel that promotes international content, whether on science, technology, culture, or academics. They invite the world's greatest minds to give their insight on a particular topic and tell a story to connect with a broader audience.

Videos on TED are usually posted daily; in this past month alone, they've shared more than 50 videos on their channel. What makes TED different is its story-driven narration. This is evident in their most viewed content, such as [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator - by Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

### 2) [Internet Historian](https://www.youtube.com/c/InternetHistorian/featured)

Internet historian is probably one of the best storytellers on YouTube. His unique animation style and uncanny humor make his video unique and full of engagement. His channel debuted back in 2017 and since then has seen massive growth.

Now the Internet historian is not a regular uploader, and it could take as much as a month before he publishes new content. Nevertheless, his mode of storytelling is what makes his channel stand out. This is apparent in his latest video, "[Man in Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9VGZeqMfo)," which makes the viewer guess what will happen next.

### 3) [Storybooth](https://www.youtube.com/c/Storybooth)

## Part II. Storytelling's Potential on Your YouTube Videos Popularity

[Studies have shown](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.581349/full) from time to time that one of the best ways to grow an audience is through the concept of storytelling. This technique is absolutely crucial for platforms like YouTube since the average engagement span of your viewer is not going to be that high.

Telling captivating stories, however, results in audience retention, increases your watch time, and even has the potential to skyrocket your subscriber count. Here are some of the benefits that storytelling YouTubers gets by simply applying this technique:

### Benefit #1: Stories form a Deeper Human Connection

The main difference between the creators blowing on YouTube and the ones publishing a lot but not getting recognition is the story. YouTubers consistently put stories in their videos, allowing them to form a deeper human connection. Their viewers are educated and connected with that person, which is the reason for their success.

### Benefit #2: Stories help the Audience to Relate

A good story solves a problem and helps people to relate. Let's suppose you are doing a tech review. In this case, you definitely want to know what type of people are listening to you and how you can solve their problems.

Through story, your problem connects with theirs, and the audience starts relating with your content. This way, they won't be bombarded by facts and information and can immerse themselves as you talk about the tech gadget.

### Benefit #3: Stories Act as a Tool for Focus Retention

There is a ton of content on YouTube, making it easier for an average viewer to get overwhelmed. Storytelling eliminates this and lets you level up your content a little bit. Even if your videos are long, story-driven content keeps your viewers engaged and looking for more!
