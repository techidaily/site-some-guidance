## Subtle Symmetry: Balancing Visuals Like a Pro

[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) is known for its advanced key features and options through which professionals enhance their photos with a few retouches. If the captured photo lacks some requirements or includes flaws, people can easily vanish the flaws through Photoshop effortlessly. You can craft any ordinary image into an incredible portrait by utilizing Photoshop smartly.

However, beginners or non-technical individuals who don't have any idea about using Photoshop may find it challenging to conduct Photoshop editing. This article has been composed to enlist some beneficial tips to use Photoshop editing without facing any inconvenience.

## Part 1: 10 Useful Photoshop Photo Editing Tips for Beginners

Have you ever used Photoshop to edit your images? If you are a beginner, read this section to get aware of 10 valuable tips for Photoshop photo editing.

### 1\. Tip 1: Sky Replacement

Do you know that Photoshop image editing can easily replace the sky in your picture with a single click? To use this feature, navigate to "Edit" and then click on "Sky Replacement." This feature will open its dialog box from which you can easily choose the sky displayed in the "Sky List."

You can also edit the edges of your sky by heading to "Shift Edge Slider," from where you can fade in or out the sky edges using the slider. To adjust the brightness, saturation, and temperature of the sky, use the option of "Sky Adjustments." Keep in mind that Photoshop has two lightning modes that are "Multiple" and "Screen."
