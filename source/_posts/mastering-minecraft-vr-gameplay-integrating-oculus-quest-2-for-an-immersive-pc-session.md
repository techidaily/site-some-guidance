## Mastering Minecraft VR Gameplay: Integrating Oculus Quest 2 for an Immersive PC Session

### Key Takeaways

* To play Minecraft VR on PC, you can use a custom shortcut to play the Bedrock edition or install the Vivecraft mod for the Java edition.
* To play the standalone version of Minecraft VR for the Meta Quest 2, you need to install the QuestCraft app using SideQuest, an alternative app store.

 Why limit yourself to experiencing the run-away gaming hit Minecraft in 2D? With the help of a VR headset, you can now fully immerse yourself in the game like never before. The process can be pretty complicated, though, so we're here to help you set it up Minecraft VR on PC and the Quest 2.

##  Can You Play Minecraft on Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro?

 Yes, you can play Minecraft in VR using the Meta Quest 2 or any other [VR headset](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/visual-harmony-ios-and-macos-photoviewer-blend/). However, the Quest 2 and Quest Pro VR headsets can also run the game without a PC. To run the game without a PC, you will just need to install QuestCraft, a standalone port of Minecraft: Java Edition.

 The easiest way to play Minecraft in VR is by using the [Bedrock edition](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-perfect-5-monitors-to-boost-your-ps5/) that you can purchase from the Microsoft store. The Bedrock edition has VR built into it, so it is easy to set up. However, this version canâ€™t be modded like the Java edition.

 Fortunately, the Java version of Minecraft VR can be installed by downloading the Vivecraft mod. In this article, we will discuss how to play Minecraft VR on all of these different versions.

##  How to Play Minecraft VR Bedrock Edition on PC

 If you have purchased Minecraft from the Oculus store, the game will show up in your VR library, and you can launch it directly from there. If you have purchased it from the Microsoft store then you might require a [custom shortcut](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-skys-limit-for-your-visual-stories-unlimited-free-options-and-premium-choices/) to launch it.

 First, make sure you have Minecraft Bedrock Edition installed and run it at least once. Right-click on your desktop, and under "New," select "Shortcut."

##  How to Play Minecraft VR on Meta Quest 2 Using QuestCraft

 You can play Minecraft VR without a PC on the Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets. All you need to do is sideload the QuestCraft app through the alternative app store known as SideQuest. For this method, you will need to enable developer mode on the Quest 2 and enable USB debugging, if you haven't already.

###  Step 1: Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging

 To enable developer mode, you will need to create a developer account by going to the [Oculus Developer website](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/). Log in to your existing Meta/Facebook/Instagram account that you use on your headset. Once you log in, create your own organization and give it a name of your choice. Check the "I Understand" box and click 'Submit'.

![Meta developer account registration](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-developer-account-registration.jpg) 

 Read through the Developer Non-Discloser Agreement, check the "I Agree" box, and click "Submit." Download the [Meta Quest app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000219/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight) on your smartphone and log in using the same account. Turn on your Quest headset, and it will automatically connect to the app if they are on the same Wi-Fi network.

 Open the app and go to Menu > Devices > Select your Quest device **\>** Headset Settings > Select Developer Mode and toggle it on.

 Restart your headset and go to Quick Settings > Settings > System > Developer > Enable USB connection dialogue. With this, you can connect your Quest headset to a PC and install apps and games from the SideQuest store.

###  Step 2: Sideload Questcraft on Meta Quest 2

 Once you have enabled both developer mode and USB debugging, make sure to [download SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) on your PC. Connect the PC and your Quest headset using a USB-C cable. A prompt will appear on your headset and ask permission to access files on the device. Select "Allow" on the prompt and the headset will be connected to the PC.

 After this, open SideQuest on your PC and make sure it is connected to the headset. Use the search option to look for QuestCraft. Click on "Sideload" to install the app on your headset.

![QuestCraft Home Screen](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/questcraft.jpg) 

 Press "Play" and it will start downloading a few files that you can see in the bottom right corner. Once all files have been downloaded, press "Play" again, and it will launch Minecraft in VR. With this, you can enjoy [playing Minecraft](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-remove-black-bars-from-youtube-videos/) in VR even without a PC. You will also be able to [download additional mods](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-google-pixel-fold-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/) to the standalone version of the game, as it is based on the Java edition. However, the performance of the standalone version of the game might not be as good as playing it on PC.
