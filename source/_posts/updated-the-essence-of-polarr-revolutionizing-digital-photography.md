### 1\. Adjustments Within Photos

The control offered across Polarr in terms of the color and tone adjustments is commendable. Being referred to as Lightroom-style details and controls, this online editor makes a proficient entry across the existing market. It offers a white balance control, which does not come with an auto-slide control tool. However, managing the color and tone across Polarr is quite effective and unique.

Users can also mainly make proper tone adjustments with the help of shadows, highlights, white balancing, and black sliders. This helps users make prolific changes across their photos.

Although we might not refer to this tool to be equivalent to the existing desktop tools with similar features, Polarr indeed returns a good result after retouching the photo that contains faces. You won't be disappointed with it.
