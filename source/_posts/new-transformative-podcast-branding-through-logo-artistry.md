### 1\. Think about where your logo will be used

The most crucial aspect of your logo is its image size and quality. Your logo will be used in various places, so you need to have a set of different sizes. Your logo will only be helpful if visible, so you must ensure that you use a high enough image quality.

### 2\. Don’t be afraid to use color

The logo's color will stir up emotions in your audience and help set the mood for your podcast. Using bright and vivid colors is the best way to capture your audience. It's vital to keep the shade constant; otherwise, you'll end up with mismatched colors.

### 3\. Avoid overused icons

Icons are a fundamental part of any logo but using bland overused icons will not let you stand out in front of other podcast creators. It's best to use unique icons that viewers are attracted to and intrigued by.

### 4\. Dont be too literal

Never limit the kind of logo you can use. Let your creativity be a region with no boundaries. Only when you let your imagination run wild will you be able to create a great logo. You should also not be afraid of simplicity. Often the simplest ideas go the longest way.
