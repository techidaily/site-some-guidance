## Airdrop Setting on iOS

Airdrop contains three options to choose from, Off, Contacts Only, and Everyone. The users can select any of these options depending upon their needs and requirements.

**Step 01:** Open Settings of your iPhone or iPad device.

**Step 02:** From all these options, Tap on General
