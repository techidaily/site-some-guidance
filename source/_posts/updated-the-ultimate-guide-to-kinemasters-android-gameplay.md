## Part 1\. What is KineMaster App?

KineMaster is probably the best video editing software for mobile devices having unique features like Chroma key, video transitions, audio/video effects, and many more, which would help you to turn your imaginations into reality.

**Download:** you can download the app from [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster/id1223932558).

**Price:** One of the best advantages of KineMaster is that it is available in free and paid versions for its users, but the question arises here. What is the difference between them? Let us tell you if you are using its free version. There are a few restrictions like you cannot access highly advanced editing tools, popular filters, effects, stickers, etc. The biggest con among them is they will put their watermark on your videos, which may affect their looks. But if you are using their paid version, you have unlimited access to everything, and there will also be no watermark on your exported videos. Also, in its free version, you may face some ads, which will not be if you use its paid version. However, you can download its cracked version from [RevDl](https://www.revdl.com/kinemaster-pro-mod-apk-download9.html/) to get unlimited access to everything without ads.

## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages of KineMaster App for Android

We can sum up the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on the practical process we described earlier.

### **Advantages:**

**Professional editing tools:**

KineMaster has more advanced and professional editing tools than any other mobile video editing application, such as Chroma key, special effects, filters, unique video transitions, etc. That is why prominent content creators have also used this application to edit their videos on mobile.

**Best Export Quality:**

Using KineMaster, you can export your videos in almost all the resolutions you want. Like QHD, FHD, HD, or SD, even if you are using its free version, which most mobile video editing applications do not allow in their free versions.

### **Disadvantages:**

**Premium features:**

However, KineMaster has the best video editing features, but they are not entirely free. To unlock some special effects and filters, stickers, clip graphics, transitions, etc., you must buy their premium version.

**Watermark:**

If you are a free user of it, you have to bear their watermark on your exported videos, which may affect the quality and the looks of your videos. However, using the RevDl website, you can download its apk mod, using which you can export your videos without a watermark.

## Part 5\. How to download KineMaster for PC?

As all of us know that KineMaster is a mobile video editing application and is not available for desktops, but still, if you guys want to use it on desktop, then you should follow the following instructions:

1. First, you have to go to WizCase.com and download the apk file of KineMaster from it.
2. You must download any android emulator like [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/video-players/kinemaster-on-pc.html) on your PC.

## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

So, the question now is: Which of its desktop alternatives is the best? It's called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.
