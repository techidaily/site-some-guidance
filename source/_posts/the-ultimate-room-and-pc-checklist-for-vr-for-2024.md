## How to prepare your room for Oculus Rift?

 Check below video for all the information you need

## What kind of Space will I need for the Oculus?

 The head tracking of Oculus Rift depends on an exterior IR LED pursuing sensor jagged at the headset, about which Oculus calls that it is a “constellation tracking system.” The radar is small and fixed on a graceful metallic stand; it seems like a discreet microphone stand with a tubular webcam fixed on top. The tracing works by sensing ultraviolet LEDs released from underneath the textile casing of the Rift headset.

**Sensor setup:** Since the stand of the sensor is comparatively short (the entire component is about 10 inches or we can say 25cm tall), you will require to place it on some desk or table in order to retain the Rift inside its field of sight though standing or sitting. That field of sight is widespread enough that you do not have to be sited square in front of it the sensor while using the Rift, in my experience, pursuing is meek and dependable after merely placing the sensor on a table pointed in my direction.

**Desk setup:**Well, nothing much precise here, but you should do yourself a courtesy and clear the room in which you are setting up and also clear your desk (or table) for the VR equipment to live. When you follow the Rift, you will not be allowed to use the controller and involved Oculus remote, so you will have to pick them up just by the touch. And that is much and much cooler to do when you have enough clear space right in front of you and you can reach to the similar place each time to grasp what you are looking for while playing. Likewise, it is pleasant to have a vacant space to put the headset when you end your game and take it off. You should be careful with it!

**Speaking of cables:**Make certain that there is a clear trail amongst your computer and where the place where you are playing your VR game, or else you might be sweeping beakers and tchotchkes off the desk just like an eager Golden Retriever along with an out of control tail. I have not had a considerable issue with the Oculus Rift in this regard since I was seated and mesmerizing an Xbox controller.

## How to Prepare a VR-Ready PC?

 Just like the PC gaming of this age, some of the VR games will be extra challenging than the others. But the reference line for an acceptable VR routine is going to be considerable higher. As of right now, you may be pleased with the 1080p and 60 fps performance. Well, that is not the case to for virtual reality. SteamVR and the customer Oculus Rift mutually use a couple of 1080x1200 shows actuality restored at 90 Hz. So, it means your computer will have to condense two monitors’ value of content at 90 fps for an even skill. Well, it is not an easy task. Well in order to enjoy the experience of Oculus on a high level, you must need these things on your PC.

* A graphic card of NVIDIA GTX 970/AMD 290 or any equivalent or greater than that.
* An additional intel graphic card of i5-4590 or may be equivalent or better.
* A Ram memory of 8GB or plus.
* A companionable HDMI 1.3 video output.

 Well, AMD also recommends an eight-core as well as six-core CPU made by AMD along with a base clock of 3.9GHz or greater, priced at $130 along with the AMD FX-6350\. On the other hand, the developers working with HTC Vive have suggested a NVIDIA setup of GTX 980.
