## Tucked Into Narratives: A Review of Evening Storytelling Videos

Technology that enables bedtime reading in virtual reality is already available, as seen in videos. Children can develop a deeper sense of their identity through bedtime stories by reflecting on their values, choosing a course of action based on the character's circumstances, and intuitively learning how to use the potential of narrative for their own lived experiences.

Additionally, children can comprehend their locations, character development, conflicts, and plotlines that have built their legends better through stories. Young people who experience difficult upbringings may start to shape their story rather than feeling defined by it. No matter the genre, humans are constantly drawn to **bedtime stories to tell**, whether they are legends and myths, fairy stories and parables, ghost adventures, and heroic exploits.

The animated story **_My No No No Day_** by Rebecca Patterson tells the tale of Bella, a little child, and her "no no no" day. It addresses feelings, connections, and obligations to other people.

At the same time, her eyes squint sulkily, and her mouth is open constantly in loud verbal protest.

**Featured Review**

**_"I think everybody has No No No days, and I love that this little girl realized she had been onery, apologized, and the mom freely forgave her! So much fun!"_**

## Part II. How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids

Like with music, some bedtime videos are better for relaxation, while others are better for fun. Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed. They calm racing thoughts and aid in acclimatizing young bodies and brains to a peaceful night.

### Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video

Here are the elements of an effective bedtime story video.

**1\. Plot**

One of the story's most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story's action and aids in presenting the events' logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot's structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.

* **Exposition**

The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story's start by introducing the cast of characters.

* **Rising Action**

A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.

* **Climax**

The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.

* **Falling action**

The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.

* **Denouement**

The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.

**2\. Music**

The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience's brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.
