### Get More Engagement With Audiences

Over the years, podcasts have shown constant growth in engaging audiences. Many actors and brands use it as a new way to get more engagement among new audiences keeping the base audience intact. In addition, with the increasing use of smartphones, live-stream video podcast listeners have increased miraculously.

And that's amazing as well when you look at the stats worldwide. According to the sources, 57% of whites, 16% of Hispanics, 13% of African Americans, and 4% of Asians currently listen to live podcast streaming.

### Express Thoughts in Real-Time

Another fantastic thing about live-stream video podcasts is the real-time expression of thoughts. You can interact with the virtual live audience and express your feelings, reviews, and ideas on many different topics. So it becomes a two-way conversation. Unlike films, seasons, or dramas, live podcasts show the real side of a person.

### Better Relationships With Audiences

Podcasts are emerging platforms for creating content. It requires a lot of creative work to get that going. However, most listeners are there to listen to live-stream video podcast content and focus more on it. So it creates a better bond. Unlike unending scrolling on social media platforms, a loyalty-based relationship is formed with the audience.

### A Huge Source of Revenue for Your Podcasts

Not only is a live-stream podcast a way of gaining access to a global audience, but also a way to generate money. A podcaster can make money through sponsorships, affiliate sales, paid subscriptions, and complementary products.

According to [Oberlo](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/podcast-revenue#:~:text=The%20latest%20statistics%20show%20that,%242.2%20billion%20by%20next%20year.)'s surveys, the latest statistics show the US is expected to hit $1.73 billion, a 28.6% annual increase in podcasting revenue. And revenue is expected to hit $2.2 billion by next year.

[Riverside](https://riverside.fm/blog/how-much-do-podcasters-make) says a podcaster can make $300-5000 per month. Affiliate sales, advertisements, paid subscriptions, and sponsorships helped podcasters to grow their income. And it also depends on the regular production of content and regular niche audience.

![money](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-3.jpg)

While according to research in the UK, podcasters make an average profit of 950 pounds a month, making an average of 11,440 pounds each year. While according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/17824/podcast-advertising-revenue-united-states/), $2.8 billion worldwide is expected to be spent on podcast ad streaming this year and will increase in the coming years.

After knowing the power of live podcast streaming, let us move towards using that power and answering the query, "How to make a live podcast?"

## Part 2\. Preparing for a Live Podcasting

Preparation and brainstorming are required to make successful live podcasting. We will discuss some key factors to make live podcasting successful here. Let us move step-wise.

### 1\. Timing Is Everything

_"What is the best time to go live?"_

There is no proper answer to this question. Several factors, like your target audience, your niche, and your geographic location, will play a part in the timing of going live. So here, we are going to give you some tips about time management.

Confirm a schedule with your guest (if you have one), ensuring you're both on the same page about timing, even if you are not in the same time zone. For example, if you want a maximum live audience in the US, then the best time for you to live stream is when most US live stream viewers are active. You have to make sure your guest should make it to go live as well, irrespective of his time zone.

Secondly, it is also vital when to hold the live podcasting. It would help if you researched what time you will get the most audience. Consider what type of content you create and what lifestyle your audience leads, and decide accordingly.

Let's get into this situation; a Sunday morning might be a good option if your podcast is about meditation and well-being, as it's a classic time for taking things slow and resetting before the coming week.

Here is a summary of different social media platforms when you get the maximum audiences.

* YouTube - Weekends 12 PM to 2 PM
* Facebook - Tuesdays and Thursdays 1 PM to 4 PM
* Twitch - All days from 1 AM to 9 AM

We now move on to take the most fundamental step of our work which is making a checklist of things to do. So let's have a look at it right now.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Preview Your Podcast Content On Scripts

World-famous podcasters map out the plans on paper. The theme, the guests, the intro of the video, and various question and answer sessions need a script to carry things smoothly.

The writing is fundamental even if you are going to hold a monologue live podcast. So you have to brainstorm your topics and decide on the podcast theme. You have to invite the guests, give your podcast a name, and get the right equipment and setup. Everything needs to be scripted to have a podcast preview.

### 3\. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly

Let's run through various gadgets used to start live podcast streaming and how to make a live podcast. Let's dive in!

**Camera**

Good display quality is the most integral part of live podcast streaming. Therefore, a reliable camera is essential for a live podcasting kit. The recommended tool for this purpose is a good-quality webcam. Unfortunately, many people use DSLR and mirrorless cameras, which aren't suitable for shooting for a long time.

Here we have some fantastic products for you as an option. When it comes to visual fidelity, 4K resolution isn't everything. Achieving superb quality is highly dependent on webcam light sensors and pixel size. Here are a few recommendations for you.

1) Smartphones

Everyone has a smartphone, and you don't need to buy a new gadget, making it a cheaper and easier option. But there are difficulties connecting it to your PC or laptop.

2) Webcams

Many laptops and PC setups have internal webcams. However, the display gets grainy sometimes. You can also go for external webcams. The external webcams are tiny and portable. Maybe, you can try [Razor Kiyo Pro](https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro) with more than two micrometers which is superior to other 4K webcams. If you are a beginner with a low budget, you can always go for alternatives.

![razor kiyo pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-6.jpg)

3) DSLR

DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera) is notable for allowing interchangeable lenses on the same camera body. However, it is just one type of digital camera. Investing in DSLR gives options for the future and provides crystal clear images, for example, [**Nikon COOLPIX B500**](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-b500.html). It captures moments in full HD 1080p quality with stereo sound. It also counteracts shaky hands for tripod-steady videos.

![nikon coolpix b500](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-7.jpg)

**XLR or USB Microphone**

You might have heard some things about XLR and USB microphones. For example, "XLR microphones sound more professional" or "USB microphones are less of a hassle." Unfortunately, XLR can't be connected directly to your computer. Instead, you'll need an audio interface to enter the digital world and want to make recordings using your computer or smartphone.

This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>

![atr 2100x-usb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-8.jpg)

1) Condenser Podcasting Microphones

Sensitive to high frequency and environmental noise. This type of microphone is usually used in recording studios.

2) USB Podcasting Microphones

Are less sensitive to ambient noise. Traditionally used by beginners.

3) XLR Podcasting Microphones

3-prong connection connected to mixer and computer. Usually used in professional setups.

**Mixers**

The mixer enhances the exemplary audio quality and offers multi-channel recordings. It also provides multiple-channel live recordings as well. Adding this to your live-streaming podcast kit helps to reduce post-production cuts.

**Lighting**

Lighting is the most intimidating part of the video live-streaming kit. It enables texture and depth to the video. Not only is the lighting essential, but also the positioning of light. It starts to create shadows on a person's face. Lighting drastically changes how someone looks in live streaming.

![elgato key light mini-portable led panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-10.jpg)

**Tripod Stands**

![ubeesize 67 phone tripod & selfie stick, and camera tripod stands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-11.jpg)

An innovative, sturdy tripod stand can hold your camera and smartphone to capture steady frame shots. There are a lot of tripod stands online as well as in the offline market ranging from inexpensive to expensive ones. You can go for a [UBeesize 67" phone tripod & selfie stick, and a Camera Tripod stands](https://www.amazon.com/UBeesize-Wireless-Perfect-Recording-Streaming/dp/B09PH9PNYY/ref=sr%5F1%5F7?keywords=tripod+stands&qid=1667903065&sr=8-7) for perfect live streaming.

**Computers**

A computer is essential to produce your show via digital audio workspace. You will need it for your post-production and editing software as well. However, a PC or laptop can work equally well in these conditions.

It is assumed that you already have that gadget. But if you don't have it and are planning to buy a new machine, you must keep its memory space, processor, and RAM in mind. So here are a few recommendations for you.

[**Acer Aspire 5 Laptops**](https://www.acer.com/us-en/laptops/aspire/aspire-5) are budget-friendly laptops, starting with 4GB RAM, 256 GB storage, and quad-core processors.

![acer aspire 5 laptops](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-12.jpg)

[**HP Pavilion AiO PC**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-pavilion-24-ca1005t-bundle-aio-pc) is another excellent option for beginners. It's budget-friendly and reliable. I have a 23.8" screen, Windows 11 Home, Intel® Core™ i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and GeForce GTX 1650.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![hp pavilion aiO pc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-13.jpg)

### 4\. Find a Proper Place for Podcast Live

Living styles and earning tactics have changed significantly in the post-pandemic era. Now you don't have to get to the offices to earn a decent earning. Instead, you can make your home studios have a live podcasting setup. Let's have a look at it.

**Home Studio**

You don't have to be hesitant to make a home studio. It has many pros, as it is easy to design and equip a recording home studio. Also, it is a long-term intelligent investing strategy, especially after the covid pandemic. Moreover, it gives a studio-quality recording.

![a home studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-14.jpg)

**Place Establishment**

Establishing a new indoor place is much cheaper and safer. However, you need the following items to develop a site for live video streaming.

* A separate room
* Sound absorbers
* Computer
* Microphones
* Mixer
* Tripod Stand
* Proper lighting
* Cables

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It'll be better to choose an indoor environment because there is too much uncertainty for outdoor places. For example, you must be aware of people passing by while live streaming a podcast in a quiet park corner. It will be difficult for you to focus. Additionally, an indoor venue can better absorb ambient noise.

### 5\. Carefully Choosing a Live Stream Platform

Having identified the gadgets and the place, we will now focus on the live-streaming platforms. It would be best to consider a few factors while starting live video streaming. These are efficiency, multi-channel usage, timing, and simplicity. Otherwise, your energies will get consumed, and you will eventually get frustrated. A list of live-streaming platforms is given below.

1. **YouTube Live Streams** make it challenging to use multi-channels simultaneously.
2. **Twitch** is the most interactive platform. However, it can range from having haha reactions to bizarre death threats.
3. **TikTok** has changed the interaction on social media, but it is available only for 16+ adults.
4. **Twitter** is less popular to the creators, has privacy issues, and has limited monetization options.
5. **Facebook Live** reaches billions of people around the globe, but technical issues happen sometimes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Check Out Your Outfit

Appearance matters! Whether you are going for an interview, going out at a party, or going live stream from home. For example, wearing darker colors may be good if you use a light background. Try not to wear some loud patterns like checks and stripes. Try to be as comfortable as you can according to the theme and content of the live stream.

## Part 3\. Live Podcasts vs. Podcast Streaming

"Are there any differences between the two?" Not at all! These are the same, but in some cases, "podcast streaming" is used for podcasts with a video element. Otherwise, these can be used interchangeably.

## Final Words

Live streaming is a new world for content creators. Even though they don't have the luxuries to edit or undo the content, that's the most fantastic part of it. You show the world your natural side. For independent broadcasters, building genuine and loyal connections is vital. There is no way better than this to go for live streaming.
