Among MovieBox users, quite a few do not like the idea of iPhone jailbreaking, so they prefer using this movie streaming app with non-jailbreak device. Also Apple apparently does not allow this kind of app in its official App Store on account of its lawfully questionable use and nature, but the developer community has a way of side-loading app. That being said, however, quite unstable. Grounded on the comments and Qs mentioned on forums, downloading and running MovieBox is hit or miss; it only works for some people, once in a while.

How to fix MovieBox stopping working problem is of essence. Here I gathered the effective solutions. Nonsense aside, let's go straight to the business.

Wonder the reason why this would **fix MovieBox stopped working problem**? Let me tell you: that's because you need to bypass the app's expired security certificate. Changing the date essentially tricks your device into thinking the certificate is still valid, thus allowing it to run.

## Part 3 - How to Troubleshoot MovieBox on iOS?

As of typing, all these apps – Popcorn Time, HD Cinema, and MovieBox are no longer working for iOS 14, let alone iOS 9\. To add to the bad news, iOS 14 plug the exploit that TaiG tool uses to jailbreak iOS 14.

There is, however, a temporary solution. I suggest you downgrade iOS 14 after downgrading iTunes 12.1, and then use **TaiG jailbreak** on Windows. As long as you have jailbroken your iOS iPhone iPad device, you are free to [install Popcorn Time](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MovieBox and HD Cinema from Cydia. And if you are running on iOS 14, please try to downgrade iOS to have a shot.
