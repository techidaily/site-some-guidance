### Never Reach out brand that you don’t believe in

Collaborating with the brand you don’t like is a wrong decision. Don’t always think about the money and the free product, but think about how you can do your job well without faking your reaction.

Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.

## Conclusion

Brand Collaboration may benefit your channel and also the brand itself, the end goal may still be to sell but business must address consumers differently, transform them first into an audience, then ask permission to distill your marketing message into meaningful content. Brand should also be listening carefully to their audience responding to their comments, questions and suggestions.

When doing a brand collaboration, you must remember don’t lose hope, your first few attempts might not return anything. Keep trying and keep making awesome content. Bigger the following, easier it is to get sponsorship. Just focus on your goal and don’t be disappointed you might get what your dream of in the perfect time.
