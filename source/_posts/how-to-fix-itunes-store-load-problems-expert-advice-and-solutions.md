**Method 1: Check Internet Connection**

Weak network connection is one of the reasons why iTunes store can't load properly. Try open iTunes store on Wi-Fi and on your iPhone iPad cellular data. On your computer, open any site to see whether it loads and if the problem is caused by internet connection. Close the Wifi and reopen it, or turn your Wi-Fi router off and turn on again. Shut down other tasks on your device that uses the same internet connection. 

Tips: have you run out of data on your iPhone? Check the data allowance and reset it if needed. Go to Settings > Mobile Data and reset the mobile data statistics. Many users possibly ignore this important step. Try resetting your network settings. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. It is also a solution worth trying when [iTunes store is unable to process purchases](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**Method 2: Just Wait for A While**

Waiting is not doing nothing. Apple server is likely too busy, which makes iTunes responses the request slowly. If your internet connection is good, you will need to wait for a few minutes and try again later. You can also check Apple's system status to see if iTunes is down and doesn't work currently. 

**Method 3: Restart**

This includes restarting software and your device. 

Close iTunes and reopen it to see if the problem persists. Sometimes iTunes glitches can prevent itself connecting to the internet and iTunes store won't load. An easy restart helps in this condition. 

Restart your device. iTunes store not loading may happen when your device slows down or there are some minor issues with your device. Learn [how to speed up iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or [make your Mac run faster](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

iTunes keeps the store pages you visit on your device. Problems would occur when there are corrupted data stored in iTunes. The iTunes store not connecting/loading issue is possibly removed by resetting the cache. It's easy to do.

Step 1: On iTunes, head to Edit > Preferences > Advanced.  
 Step 2: Find out Reset iTunes Store cache and click Reset cache. 

**Method 5: Update iTunes**

Update iTunes to the latest version and reopen it to see if it works. On PC, you can uninstall and reinstall iTunes. Try logging in with a different Apple ID. Update to the latest iOS, macOS, or Windows operating system sometimes also helps. For Windows users, they can uninstall and reinstall iTunes. 

**Method 6: Try Logging out and Logging in**
