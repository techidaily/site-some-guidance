##  Why ChatGPT Shows a "Too Many Requests in an Hour" Error

 ChatGPT displays a "Too many requests in an hour. Try again later" message when you've entered too many queries in a short period of time. This error locks you out of the site and prevents you from entering further queries.

 While ChatGPT has no official guidelines as to [how many questions you can ask in an hour](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/pathway-to-profit-via-youtubes-cp2024-program/), prompting the tool with too many queries in a short span of time can trigger the tool to lock you out.

###  Check If ChatGPT Is Down

 Another reason you get a "too many requests an hour" error is that [ChatGPT is down](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-game-changing-ps4-screen-recordings-using-obs/). The site's servers may be experiencing issues, being unable to serve your queries.

 In this case, head to the [OpenAI Status](https://status.openai.com/) site and check the ChatGPT's current status. If this site tells you that the platform is down, wait until the issues are fixed and [the site is back up](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-price-tag-shooting-your-next-music-video/).

###  Use Another ChatGPT Account

 ChatGPT's "Too many requests in an hour. Try again later" message is tied to [your account on the site](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/channel-catalysts-affiliates-aiding-budgeted-buzzers-for-2024/). This means, if you switch to another account, you can possibly fix your issue.

 To do that, either create a new ChatGPT account or use the secondary account you already have. That will help you get around the above error on the site.

###  Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus

[Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/) 

###  Use a ChatGPT Alternative

 ChatGPT isn't the only AI tool on the market. That means, if you can't access this tool, use the [alternatives](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-must-know-methods-to-record-on-your-ipad/) on the market to perform your tasks. For example, [use Bing Chat AI](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-insiders-look-at-securing-fb-status-videos/) that works pretty much the same way as ChatGPT (Bing Chat AI uses [GPT 4](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-15-best-strongest-pokemon-to-use-in-pokemon-go-pvp-leagues-for-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) in its backend). You can only use this tool in Edge, but we have a workaround that lets you [use Bing Chat AI in Chrome](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-journey-to-stickers-full-tutorial-for-turning-gifs-in-chat-apps-like-discord-and-telegram/).

 There are also other AI tools, like [AI-based art generators](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-synthesize-stellar-titles-using-ai-insights/), which you can use.

###  Try Again After an Hour

 If you can't or don't wish to use the above methods, your last option is to do what the error message says---wait an hour. After that time period, ChatGPT will lift your account restrictions and let you start talking to the AI tool again.

 And those are the things you can do when ChatGPT won't let you enter anymore [prompts](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-achieve-higher-interactions-mastering-the-art-of-square-videos-for-2024/).
