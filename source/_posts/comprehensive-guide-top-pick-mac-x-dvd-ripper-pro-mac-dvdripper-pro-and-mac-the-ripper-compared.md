## Mac DVD Ripper Review: MTR VS Mac DVDRipper Pro VS MacX DVD Ripper 



_I'm considering purchasing a product for my relatively new iMac to substitute for programs like AnyDVD or DVDFab for Windows. The three products I've narrowed it down to at this point are the MacX DVD Ripper Pro, Mac DVDRipper Pro, or Mac The Ripper. I'd love to get some hands on feedback from those of you who have experience using one or more of them regarding their capabilities, pros/cons, similarities, differences, etc._ \- MacRumors

_It's just that one review I read from Macworld, looking at Mac DVDRipper Pro and MacTheRipper, implied that they deals with good DVD rips on Mac. One further point. I see MacXDVD advertises MacX DVD Ripper Pro. Is this program one and the same as the former two?_ \- Macworld

Albeit MacX DVD Ripper Pro, Mac DVDRipper Pro and Mac The Ripper have won a great many thumbs ups among worldwide customers for their extraordinary DVD ripping ability on OS X, some people still prone to get mixed up with the three Mac DVD rippers due to their near-identical names. If you want to get a clear idea about the three software, the DVD ripper for Mac review regarding features, capabilities, speed, quality, easiness, ups and downs, etc will be of great help to you.

### MacX DVD Ripper Pro

[MacX DVD Ripper Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), developed by MacXDVD Software, is highly deemed as the world's No.1 hit DVD ripper for Mac that combines with first-rate DVD decryption technology and makes DVD rips on Mac as easy as possible. Being on a par with or even better than the other two programs, MacX not only disables copy protection measures on new DVD movies, like CSS encryption, region code, Sony ARccOS, Disney X-project protection, etc, but also helps to rip DVD to MP4, MOV, WMV, FLV, AVI, and other digital formats, making it a bit more favored compared to Mac DVDRipper Pro and MacTheRipper because they only extracts commercial DVD movies to hard drive but don't convert the source movie for playing on mobile devices. 

[Download for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) [Download for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) 

What's at stake, it's at your disposal to copy main title DVD, clone DVD to ISO image, MOV, WMV, FLV, AVI and even backup DVD to MKV with original video and audio quality using this Mac DVD ripping software, almost 5 minutes only to copy a DVD on a Mac. At the same time, MacX has 400+ presets for your mobile devices - whether it be Apple, Android, or Google, which could not be found in Mac DVDRipper Pro and MacTheRipper.

 It makes backups of your DVD for your gadget like iPhone, the new 9.7inch iPad, Apple TV, iMovie, Android, etc extremely easy. The end-result quality and DVD ripping speed are never disappointing, almost the same as original and 36X faster speed compared with other similar DVD ripper for Mac. Below is the software giant review: 

![Mac The Ripper Alternative](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/ll-mdrp-090401.jpg) 

_MacX DVD Ripper Pro is a terrific DVD to iPod converter for Mac software app, and it works fast while maintaining a high level of quality. Both beginners and advanced users can work with the default conversion settings, which are fully customizable. The broad range of supported devices is also a terrific feature, making it an all-in-one DVD to iPod converter for Mac app._  \- TopTenReviews

### Mac DVDRipper Pro

DVDSuki Software' Mac DVDRipper Pro resembles much to MacX DVD Ripper Pro regarding to their names, just a subtle difference of "X", but they are produced by totally two different companies. The former is also highly acclaimed for its easiness during DVD ripping process on Mac. The latest version Mac DVDRipper Pro 7.2.1 is preloaded with OCR subtitles to icnrease ripping speed and adds 30 DVDs to the internal database. Mac DVDRipper Pro also supports encrypted DVDs such as CSS protected discs and has the knack for automatically choosing the right title. But if you face with a DVD reporting a false capacity, say, 60GB or containing a series of false titles, or so, you can rely on this MacX DVD Ripper Pro as it has a good knack for decrypting discs, thus leaving you with an archive file playable on Mac. 

![Mac DVDRipper Pro](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/mac-dvdripper-pro.png) 

It is built in as most 3 backup modes, allowing you to copy full or main movie title at your disposal. Like MacX DVD Ripper Pro, DVD Suki Software also let you can choose soft or hard subtitles. Since Mac DVDRipper Pro is dedicated to Mac users, it enables DVD conversion to M4V that is readable by Apple iPhone, iPad, iTunes, QuickTime and more. But if you are working with non-Apple ecosystem, Mac DVDRipper Pro isn't as optimal as MacX DVD Ripper Pro or Handbrake. Plus, its ability to control over intentionally bad sectors that can interfere with a rip is confounding. Also, you can't extract a disc's main feature, or episodes from a TV compilation DVD.

### Mac The Ripper

Frankly, Mac The Ripperis older than the other two software and fits into the first class for its simplicity and powerful DVD decrypting ability. This [free DVD ripper for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) creates a playable copy of DVD by defeating CSS encryption and disabling region code of the copied data. But the down sides are MacTheRipper is available in a secrecy and back-alley character, which can be a much annoying thing, and the absence of support team makes Mac The Ripper fail to catch up with the latest Mac OS versions Mountain Lion and Mavericks. Similar to Mac DVDRipper Pro, Mac The Ripper may only copy DVD on Mac in VIDEO\_TS folder, getting you like an ant on iron for other tool to convert the movie.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Note 1:** The original page of MacTheRipper v1.0 - v2.6.6 that was at [http://mactheripper.org/](https://tools.techidaily.com/macdvdripperpro/products/) is gone, which is now replaced by a redirect link to a URL for a commercial product called Mac DVDRipper Pro by DVDSuki Software. But it shall be notified that MacTheRipper and Mac DVDRipper Pro are totally different programs. 

**Note 2:** MacTheRipper 4 is a payware now. But there is still no official direct download for trying the new version. So regular users will find it difficult to download MacTheRipper as well as buy it online. What's more, it is not fully compatible with Mountain Lion or Mavericks, so getting [MacTheRipper alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is a good idea.

### Verdict 

All MacX DVD Ripper Pro, Mac DVDRipper Pro and Mac The Ripper offer an intuitive interface. The $24.95 Mac DVDRipper Pro and the free Mac The Ripper are equally matched, both copying protected DVD but leaving you with an archive that you can play on your Mac rather than iPhone, iPad and Android provided you don't convert the movie to the device you want to watch. 

However, considering to the price tag, MacTheRipper is apparently bang for the buck. Well, MacX DVD Ripper Pro boasts excellent DVD ripping feature, supports a truckload of output formats, features a similar intuitive Mac-style interface, and provides you with no quality loss yet ensures a fast ripping process. The quality in the decryption rips didn't vary as they preserved the original video. So MacX DVD Ripper Pro gets my vote here. Whatever, it's your decision now. Just read the detailed comparison among the three DVD rippers below.

Below is a brief comparison between top 3 DVD Ripper for Mac.
