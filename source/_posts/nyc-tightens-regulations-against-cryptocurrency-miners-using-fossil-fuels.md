## NYC Tightens Regulations Against Cryptocurrency Miners Using Fossil Fuels

Cryptocurrency mining often requires massive amounts of electricity, especially for [proof-of-work chains](https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/blinking-void-after-graphic-patch/) like Bitcoin. That power sometimes comes from fossil fuels, which the state of New York wants to limit.

 New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill into law on Tuesday that aims to limit the use of environmentally-damaging fossil fuels for cryptocurrency mining. It sets a two-year moratorium on new and renewed air permits for fossil fuel power plants used for energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining. The law also instructs New York's Department of Environment Conservation to evaluate how cryptocurrency mining affects the state's climate goals.

 Governor Hochul said in a statement, "I will ensure that New York continues to be the center of financial innovation, while also taking important steps to prioritize the protection of our environment."

 Environmental impact is a common criticism of cryptocurrency, as many blockchains are built on proof-of-work, which uses significant amounts of energy to verify each transaction compared to regular banks and digital payments. Newer blockchains use a more efficient proof-of-stake model, but not Bitcoin and some other chains. The Ethereum blockchain [migrated to proof-of-stake](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-secrets-of-sending-mmc-films-to-vimeo/) earlier this year.

 The [extensive use](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/climate/bitcoin-china-energy-pollution.html) of [fossil fuels](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/bitcoin-miners-align-fossil-fuel-firms-alarming-environmentalists-n1280060) is one of the most significant problems with cryptocurrency. Many other industries rely heavily on fossil fuels, but at least you usually get something useful in the end, like a car or computer. Pumping toxic fumes into the air for Bitcoin mining just gets you money [that isn't very good at being money](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vdv-hd-screen-grabber-review-the-ultimate-guide/).
