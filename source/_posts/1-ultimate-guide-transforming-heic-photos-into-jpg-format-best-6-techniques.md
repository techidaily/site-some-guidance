Apple added support for HEIC format in iOS 17, that means users don't have to walk the fine line between image quality loss and file size. HEIC format sounds much more 21st-century, however, unlike 25-year-old JPG format that is universally accepted, Apple devices other than running iOS 17, macOS High Sierra, and tvOS 11 or later cannot[open and view HEIC format pictures](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/view-read-open-heic-on-mac.htm
). Not to mention that HEIC brings the very real possibility of causing format compatibility issues with Android, Windows, photo editing and photography apps, for instance: 

_**Case 1:** When I download a shared photo album from an iPhone to my Android phone I can't open them because they are in the new HEIC format._

**Case 2:** HEIC unsupported. When I try to open a HEIC format photo taken by iPhone 7 on Photoshop, I get this error: Unsupported Format.

HEIC will be the image format of the future, it just needs some time to be widely accepted without requiring HEIF (.heic) to JPG conversion. Put wide compatibility of JPG format aside, HEIC has plenty of distinct advantages over JPG format. 

**File size and quality.** HEIF (.heic), High Efficiency Image File Format, requires nearly half the file size (bandwidth) of JPEGs without decreasing image quality. That means you can save a lot of space on your iPhone 7/8/X running iOS 17, yet with better image quality. See the file size [comparison of JPG and HEIC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) format in detail below.

Image 1 - JPG: 2.5MB, HEIC: 742KB  
Image 2 - JPG: 2MB, HEIC: 648KB  
Image 3 - JPG: 3.3MB, HEIC: 1.2MB

**Efficiency.** HEIF edges over JPG in efficiency, for example, HEIF is a container image format that can also include text and audio, or a sequence of images. HEIF images can be encoded and decoded in a much faster speed using less battery power on iPhone 7 or later. Once web pages and applications start to adopt HEIF image format, the time it takes to download HEIF images can be dramatically reduced. And HEIF format has the ability to store editing operations like rotation, cropping, and the change of the orientation, which makes it good for editing without additional re-encoding process. 

If you are fine with HEIF images, stay with HEIF.
