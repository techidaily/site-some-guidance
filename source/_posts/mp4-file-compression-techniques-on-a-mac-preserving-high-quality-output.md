## Why Need to Compress MP4 File Size

MP4 used to the best format that balances the file size and video quality. But as videos come with increasinly higher resolutions, such as 4K UHD 2160P, MP4 is not as efficient to store the massive data. Besides freeing up your space by compressing MP4 videos, there're other reasons why it's urgent to compress video files of MP4\. 

* Let's see the file size of a MP4 video in current resolutions:
* iPhone - a 1080P HD video at 60fps in H.264 MP4 is 175MB per minute, and a minute of 4K UHD video at 60fps takes up 400MB for HEVC.
* GoPro HERO camera - a 4K UHD video at 30fps in H.264 MP4 is 480MB per minute;
* DLSR cameras - a 4K UHD video at 24fps in H.264 MP4 is about 1.1GB to 2.2GB per minute.

1\. In spite MP4 is regarded as one of the best video formats for various platforms, the file with larger size usually gives rise to YouTube upload failure, not to mention slow upload speed. So you need a MP4 compressor to shrink MP4 file size down so as to share it on YouTube or Facebook faster and successfully.

2\. E-mailing an MP4 video clip with smaller size to friends is much easier and faster than a larger one. 

3\. For a successful playback of a HD video on a small-screen phone, you need to resize MP4 to fit the screen, see with the help of a professional [MP4 video reducer](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

## How to Make MP4 File Size Smaller on Mac

There are effective ways to trim down its size without compromising much on quality. Before you get any MP4 video compressor for Mac, let's dive into some simple yet powerful techniques to reduce the size of your MP4 file on Mac for sharing, storing, or uploading.

### 1\. Transcode MP4 to a Smaller-Sized FLV, WMV, HEVC

There is a bewildering array of video formats besides MP4 - AVI, WMV, FLV, MOV, MKV, etc for compressing files, - and on top of that, how these formats stack up against each other, especially in terms of providing smaller file size than MP4? Which one is the best format to [shrink and transcode MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to? Below we list two video formats with file size smaller than MP4\. 

**• WMV:** The file format is a tightly compressed format that requires a minimal amount of storage space, thus dramatically decreasing the size and increasing load time. It's proved the file size of MP4 is **reduced by 60%** after converting MP4 to WMV. But you must know WMV has bad compatibility with non-windows platforms, like iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices, and Linux players. This is way WMV isn't the standard web format. 

**• FLV:** It's a suitable format for web video. It's viewable by over 90% web visitors, small in size and easly to be downloaded. So it's workable to compress MP4 to smaller FLV for web upload. However, it's expensive and time consuming to create an FLV content and you will spend a longer wait time to access a web page with Flash, especially when you are using a dial up connection. If you hope to decrease MP4 file size, especially for uploading to YouTube, Facebook, etc, it's advised to convert MP4 to smaller sized FLV with this [MP4 video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**• HEVC:** HEVC is a format developed to take place of MP4 H.264 to store high-definition videos. It can save 50% of space compared with H.264 at the same quality. Therefore, you can compress MP4 videos to HEVC to downsize the video, especially the source MP4 is in HD or 4K resolutions. You can select MP4 H.265 as the output format, or change the video codec to H.265 in the video parameter settings. Currently, HEVC is supported in major video editors, players, websites, web players, converters etc.

### 2\. Change Parameter Settings 

**• Lower video resolution**: The video resolution is closely bound up with video size and quality. Higher resolution usually results in larger video file size. But don't expect a better video viewing experience on a device with smaller display resolution when playing a video with higher resolution, e.g. play a 4k MP4 video on iPhone 6\. Changing the original video to a smaller resolution will lead to a smaller file size. 

For a 4K MP4 video, as high as 3840×2160, it's recommended to reduce to 1920×1080, 1280×720, 800×600, 640×480, 640×360 using a [video resolution converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Generally, **640×480 is recommended** as it is a good replacer for HD video, suitable for most devices (iPhone, iPad, Android) and fits for many websites (YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo), if you don't care much about the artifacts of compressed file. 

**• Chance codec to H.264/H.265**: MP4 video format supports a wide range of codecs, incl. MPEG4, H.264, H.263, VC-1, Dirac, MPEG2, MPEG1, H.265(HEVC), among which HEVC is much favored for its higher compression ratio. It's reported HEVC doubles the compression ratio of the standard H.264 and therefore reduces the file size by about 39-44% at the same level of quality compared to H.264, let alone MPEG4\. So if your MP4 is encoded with MPEG4 or H.264 and don't want to change the video format, just shrink MP4 H.264 to H.265 to make it much smaller. 

**• Decrease Bit rate**: As for the bit rate, lowering the bit rate will bring about the decrease of the video file size. But please keep in mind the image quality will be bad in case you make the bit rate too low. We suggest you lowering bit rate   **20-30%** of original file.

**• Reduce Frame rate**: With regard to frame rate, it has a lot to do with the file size. the lower frame rate, the smaller size you will get, and vice versa. Below is the suggested MP4 compression settings for YouTube as well as Vimeo. You can **set it at 23.97fps** to lower the file size of MP4\. 

For online videos to be uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo, the best MP4 compression settings are suggested as below: change the codec to H.264 as it balances the high visual quality and efficient MP4 file size, choose a constant frame rate instead of a variable frame rate or keep it original, set the bit rate to 18 or below and make sure the audio codec is AAC-LC at a sample rate of 48 kHz.

For small space occupation and better playback on mobiles, it's advised to tweak the MP4 resolution to 640×480, with a video codec in H.264.

It's also the ideal iPhone manager for you to free up space on iPhone iPad iPod by transferring iOS photos, videos, music and more if you have no extra space for videos storage, instead of deleting anything you don't want to. 

### #2\. QuickTime Player 

For Mac users seeking a quick and simple way to compress MP4 videos on Mac without the need for additional software, QuickTime Player serves as a handy tool. Its ease of use and availability as a built-in application make it convenient for basic compression needs. Still, users requiring more nuanced control over compression settings might find its options limited.

The compression process in QuickTime involves navigating to the "File" menu, selecting "Export As," and then choosing from a few preset options such as 4K, 1080p, 720p, or 480p, each utilizing either the H.264 or HEVC (H.265) codec for compression. The resolution options vary from up to 3840 x 2160 for 4K down to 640 x 480 for 480p. The "Use HEVC" option, especially for 1080p resolution or higher, employs the HEVC (H.265) codec, known for its superior compression efficiency compared to H.264, potentially offering better results in reducing file sizes while retaining quality.

However, Apple's QuickTime doesn't provide extensive customization options like adjusting specific bit rates or other detailed settings, which might limit users looking for more precise control over their compression settings. QuickTime's compression settings don't always give precise information about the final resolution or data rate of the compressed video. Apple doesn't explicitly clarify whether these settings strictly depend on the original file or if there's some automatic adjustment.

I must admit the MP4 processing speed is closely related to my computer hardware configuration and network connection speed. If your hardware and network connection is good enough, the speed will get enhanced greatly.

### Conclusion

In the realm of MP4 video compression software for Mac, each option carries its own strengths and limitations. MacX Video Converter Pro impresses with its substantial file size reduction capabilities and efficient batch processing. iMovie and QuickTime, while convenient for Mac users, offer simpler compression options suitable for basic needs. Handbrake provides granular control but might be slightly technical for beginners. Online compressors like Clipchamp offer ease of use but may lack advanced customization.
