## Part 1\. What is VivaCut Video Editor App?

VivaCut is one of the best applications to edit your videos professionally on your mobile. Whether a professional or a beginner, it helps you in all aspects of video editing, even if you want to make a movie or a short video. Its advanced editing features and a user-friendly interface allow users to make their videos look excellent. It allows you to quickly do your video editing and export them to your video gallery using its free version, as most of the basic features are available in it.

### **Download:**

You can get the app from the app store by clicking the link below. The device supports the two most popular mobile operating systems: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.videoeditorpro.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)| [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vivacut-effect-video-editor/id1489090374)

### **Price:**

Even if you haven't bought any premium package, you can still use the VivaCut application and do simple editing for your videos. But the major con of using its free version is that it puts its watermark on the exported video, which may affect your video's look. To remove this watermark from your videos, you must purchase one of their premium packages (monthly or yearly). Moreover, if you want some more professional features, add INS or plugins and effects in it and remove the ads from it, you also have to purchase their premium version.

## Part 2\. Key features of the VivaCut Video Editor App
