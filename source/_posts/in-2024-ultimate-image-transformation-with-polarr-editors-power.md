Talking online photos, editors provide beginners the perfect option of making a significant change in their careers and skills. Polarr provides essential features which help users take an ideal photo editing system for themselves. The following discusses some key features of this online tool.

### 2\. Face Correction

Although we might not refer to this tool to be equivalent to the existing desktop tools with similar features, Polarr indeed returns a good result after retouching the photo that contains faces. You won't be disappointed with it.
