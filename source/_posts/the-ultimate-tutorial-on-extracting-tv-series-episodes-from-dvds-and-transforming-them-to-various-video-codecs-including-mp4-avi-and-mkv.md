**Warm Prompt:**

Some unexpected conditons will occur on some TV show/series DVDs, not all, when you rip several titles from TV series or TV show DVDs. The specific cases are below: 

**1.** Rip title 1 > The actual result you get is: title 1+ title 2+ title 3;   
**2.** Rip title 2 > The actual result you get is: title 2+ title 3.

This case does not happen often, but it does exist. The effective **solution** is:

 Go to DVD editing section > Tick "Enable Trimming" > set the Start Time as 00:00:00 and End Time with right title length. Usually a TV series episode title is around 20-60 mins. Make your own judgment based on the specific matter.
