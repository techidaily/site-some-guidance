## Part 3\. Is an audio interface a must for podcasters?

No, since without an audio interface, the recording could be done manually through other means. Therefore, the audio interface helps you record podcast episodes with better quality and higher fidelity, making it easier for listeners to hear your voice.

**This means an audio interface is not needed to record a podcast or voiceover but is recommended.** With any audio editing or recording, you must ensure that your audio interfaces work in tandem with your computer sound card.

### What types of recording setups require an audio interface?

For example, record an acoustic guitar to hear the difference between the various pickup types (strings, bridge, neck, etc.).

You can‚Äôt do this without an audio interface. Or, If you plan on making music or mixing audio, you‚Äôll need an audio interface; in addition, those who work within bigger setups to make professional-looking audio give you all the tools necessary to process, mix and master your audio files.

## Part 4\. Does an audio interface improve sound quality?

 Most people were left to wonder whether or not an audio interface made any difference in the sound quality of their recordings. The answer is a resounding yes. An audio interface makes it easier to create better-sounding music, and the equipment is essential to recording high-quality music for distribution.

### What does ‚Äúbetter audio quality‚Äù mean?

‚ÄúA better audio quality‚Äù means you can understand people‚Äôs voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.‚Äù In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person‚Äôs mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine ‚Äúbetter audio quality‚Äù?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.
