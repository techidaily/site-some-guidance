_There are many downloaded YouTube videos on my computer and most of them are formatted with MP4 (H.264), FLV, AVI, MOV, etc. I want to convert YouTube to HEVC for replaying on my iOS 11 iPhone X. Is there any proper YouTube to HEVC video converter for recommendation?_ 

As is known to all, though HEVC offers higher compression ration than H.264, it has not been adapted universally like H.264\. YouTube doesn't support uploading video files encoded with HEVC/H.265 and they still don't have any plans to support it, at least for the time being. That is to say, you can't get HEVC videos from YouTube directly. Commonly, your downloaded video from YouTube is formatted with MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, 3GPP, MPEG4, WMV, MPEGPS or WebM. These YouTube supported format videos perhaps are bigger size or blurry. Thus, how to make downloaded YouTube video size smaller and improve video quality at the same time? Simply, you can convert YouTube MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, etc to HEVC/H.265.
