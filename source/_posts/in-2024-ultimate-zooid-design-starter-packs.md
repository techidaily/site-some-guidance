### 4\. Insane Intro

If you are looking for a completely unique text effect intro, this is the one for you. The animation begins really small for the screen. Then suddenly it bursts and takes the full frame. The most eye-catching aspect of the intro is the text effect. The text has a 3D effect and crystal texture combined in perfect layers.

There are several animations applied to the text. The dynamic background video enhances the effect. You can put impactful background music to complement the intro animation. Starting from spinning animations to close-up and lighting animations, you get everything in one package.

### 6\. 2D Geometric Intro

If you do not fancy 3D texts and you want a simple but effective intro video, this can suit you perfectly. The text has a 2D texture and the animations are very basic. However, it manages to create an impact in the eyes of the beholders.

There are several dynamic geometric shapes available that enhance the animations and effects on the texts. The text performs twists and turns along with shakes with the beats. The background color is black and hence, the focus is on the text and its surrounding visible objects.
