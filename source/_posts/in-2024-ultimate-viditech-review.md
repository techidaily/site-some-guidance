## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages Of The VivaVideo Video Editor App

While VivaVideo has a lot of features that make it an excellent choice for many people, there are some advantages and disadvantages that you should be aware of before you download the app.

**Advantages:**

Rated 3.8 out of 5 stars on the G2 platform, the VivaVideo app comes with various features that make it a powerful tool for creating high-quality videos. These features include pre-built templates, fonts and text styles, numerous filters, themes for different occasions, and effects to help you give a new look to your clips.

**Disadvantages:**

In the free version, the VivaVideo editor app offers very limited features for video editing and does not let you edit or export a video clip for longer than 5 minutes. Moreover, ads will appear during the editing process, and a watermark will also be added to your video, which cannot be removed unless you avail of the VIP or premium version.

## Part 5\. Best VivaVideo App Alternative On Desktop

Although mobile video editing apps can be worth trying, desktop software is still more advantageous. Some most notable benefits of using desktop video editors over their mobile counterparts are the following:

**More Features:** Desktop video editors usually have more features than most mobile editing apps. This means that you can do more with your videos, such as adding special effects, transitions, and titles.

**Greater Control:** With a desktop video editor, you have greater control over the final product. This is because you can fine-tune every video aspect, from the frame rate to the audio levels.

**Easier To Use:** Desktop video editors are typically more straightforward to use than mobile apps. This is because they have a larger screen to work on and a more robust interface.
