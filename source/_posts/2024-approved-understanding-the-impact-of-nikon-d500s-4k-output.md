 Nikon D300 was launched into market several years ago with few basic specifications and minimalistic design. After that its successor 300S joined the race of digital cameras and performed well for years but now you must be curious to know about the latest addition in this series that is D500\. It was the very first camera model that offered 4K recording ability at consumer friendly price range and the incredible quality was ensured with advanced APS-C sensors. You will find D500 good in making color adjustments with great dynamic range and it always leads to sharp details.
