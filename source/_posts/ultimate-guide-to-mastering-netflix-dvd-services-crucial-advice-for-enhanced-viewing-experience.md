###  A. Is it legal to copy Netflix's DVDs?

"I wonder if it is okay to save DVDs rented from Netflix so that i can watch them on planes. If i carry the DVD with me, it may get damaged or lost and i will have to pay for it. So i simply copy it to my laptop and delete it after I finish. Is that legal?"

You must know that in some countries such as US, you're not allowed to rip DVD movies rented from Netflix or other services, and you can't even do it with your legally bought ones. However, there are some grey areas. It is widely considered as reasonable to create a mobile copy of Netflix movie rental DVD for easier playback during the rental period. But you must delete the copy when you return the disc. Anyway, you'd better consult the DRM law in your area. 

###  B. Can Netflix find out if I copy the rented DVDs?

"I recently want to rip a DVD I rented from Netflix, but I'm considering the legality. I want to buy the full DVD but it's a foreign movie and is distributed in other areas that I can't get to. Will Netflix tell if i have ripped its DVD?"

The answer is no. There are users concerning that Netflix may include some special tech built in the disc, then if users [copy Netflix rental DVDs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and play them back, the tech will automatically report the IP address to the central server. Ripping is a process that only read the information stored on the disc, and copy the content out. The entire ripping and playback happens offline on your computer; there is no easy way that the rental company can tell if the disc is copied. 

### C. Why the ripped DVD is in bad quality?

"I tried to rip a Netflix rental DVD to stream to my iPhone, but it comes out all static and scrabbled. Does the problem something to do with some anti-rip scheme that Netflix imposed on their DVDs?"

Some users who rip DVDs rented from Netflix for easier streaming only to find the output videos are scrambled, have no audio or no video but only audio, or out-sync picture and audio... Those are problems caused by DVD encryption measures, imposed not by Netflix, but the movie studios. For this purpose, MacX DVD Ripper Mac Free Version is a good program to rip protected DVDs from Netflix.

2\. $7.99 a month for unlimited plan with 1 DVD out at a time;

###  E. Netflix DVD vs. streaming

When Netflix separates DVD and streaming options for each $7.99 a month, while many users are complaining about the price rise, many others start to wondering if it's worth for Netflix DVD rental over another option.

**2\. Better quality** \- Blu-ray discs is a part of Netflix DVD services, which offer you better quality than you can stream over the internet. This is because that even when you stream a movie at the same resolution, it needs more compression than Blu-ray disc to stream over the internet.

**3\. No internet buffering** \- Movies streaming, especially those in HD and 4K requires strong internet connection. If not, you will suffer a lot of buffering.
