## Tips to Select the Best DVD Ripper for Mac

There is a plethora of free DVD ripping software for Mac, each of which claims to rip any DVD to any format, such as MP4, MOV, MPEG, H.264, and so on. Make sure it's the best free Mac DVD ripper before downloading the program. Otherwise, you may find yourself busy with troubleshooting as it crashes constantly, fails to load the DVD, gets choppy video on output, or keeps giving messages like "no valid source found", etc. Here are 5 criteria to consider.

**1\. macOS Compatibility**: macOS Sonoma and M1/2 Macs weed out 32-bit apps, causing many non-Apple apps, including DVD rippers, to hang at launch. The best DVD ripper for Mac should work with Macintosh to M1/M2 Macs running Sonoma. 

**2\. Fast Speed**: Some Mac DVD rippers rely on the CPU, whereas others can double or triple the speed with GPU concurrent computing. If you have hundreds of DVDs to be digitized, choose a DVD ripper for Mac that supports GPU acceleration. 

**3\. High Quality**: DVD transcoding entails codec compression, which invariably results in quality degradation. By virtue of an advanced video transcoding kernel, good DVD ripping software for Mac can create high-quality movie files with imperceptible loss of quality (the bitrate should be around 1500 kbps). 

**4\. Ease of Use**: Great tools will feature an intuitive interface with features clearly marked and locally placed, leaving little room for guesswork. Preferably, users can go from [DVD to digital](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) on Mac within 3 clicks, regardless of their computer skills. 

**5\. Rip protected DVDs**: When handling DVDs with protections, some free DVD rippers end up with errors like halfway encoding, unwatchable rips, etc. Good DVD ripping software for Mac should be able to remove copy protections as all commercial DVDs are copy-protected.

**6\. Extra features**: It will be better if the Mac DVD ripper can adjust video parameters, trim, add subtitles, merge titles, etc.

**Performance Tests:** 

MacX DVD Ripper did a **great job selecting the right title**. While Handbrake, VLC, or other free Mac DVD rippers encountered errors, crashed unexpectedly, or produced faulty rips.

It provided an average ripping speed of **240 fps**, doubling Handbrake's speed. Ripping the entire Frozen 2 DVD to MP4 took only 12 minutes, an I was able to multitask seamlessly with minimal CPU usage (around 131-134%).

It took several minutes to back up a movie directly into MKV format. For MP4 conversion, it efficiently compresses the DVD (7.84GB) into a smaller 1.61GB file with minimal quality loss (720x480 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio). The resulting MP4 file maintains near-identical quality to the source DVD, with only minor pixel-level differences.

* This free Mac DVD ripper stands out for its speed and stability when converting DVDs to digital files.

**Verdict:** MacX DVD Ripper Free Edition offers a user-friendly way to rip and back up your DVDs on Mac. It's particularly helpful if you have a collection of DVDs, including those with strong copy protection, that you want to preserve digitally. The fast speed and ready-made profiles all make the ripping process a no-brainer experience. But it lacks more advanced features like editing or fine-tuning the ripping process.

 While iSuper DVD Ripper ripped some older homemade DVDs to Mac successfully in my tests, we did encounter some issues: In some cases, the audio might go out of sync with the video or be missing entirely during playback. The ripped videos might not fill your entire TV screen, leaving black bars on the top and bottom. The free trial allows you to try the software, but many desirable output formats are locked and require purchasing the paid version.

**Pros** 

* The free Mac DVD ripper is available on the Mac APP Store.
* iSuper DVD Ripper is able to rip a DVD free on Mac to a wide range of output video and audio formats.
* It offers the ability to add audio/video effects, crop, rotate, add watermarks, merge, record, etc.

**Cons** 

* iSuper DVD Ripper for Mac is able to rip unencrypted DVDs only.
* It lacks the functions to make an intact copy of a DVD on Mac, such as rip a DVD to ISO image.
* iSuper DVD Ripper for Mac works well on even difficult DVDs but needs a fair amount of setup.
* The ripped DVD files are often out of sequense and you need to manually move each file has to the right place.
* DVD ripping errors occur sometimes, such as missing audio, black bars, audio and video go out of sync, etc.

**Verdict:** iSuper DVD Ripper is a simple solution for ripping unprotected homemade DVDs to MP4 on your Mac. However, if you need to handle copy-protected discs or require more advanced features, consider other Mac DVD rippers.

##  No.4 - [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

* **Price:** Free
* **Compatibility:** macOS 10.13 and later; Windows 10 and later; Linux
* **Latest version:** 1.7.3 (Febuary 11, 2024)

Handbrake is one of the best Mac DVD rippers for converting DVD/Blu-ray to your digital library for use on iTunes, DLNA, websites, etc. It can freely convert DVD to MP4 and MKV in H.265, H.264, H.265 MPEG-4 and MPEG-2, VP8, VP9, and Theora. There are pre-configured settings optimized for Apple, Android, Roku, PSP, Xbox, Web, etc.

Handbrake is also one of the best free choices to [convert DVD to MP4 on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Why? Because it supports AMD VCE, Apple VideoToolbox, Intel Quick Sync Video, and NVIDIA NVENC GPU acceleration for H.264/HEVC encoding. Generally, Handbrake auto enables HW acceleration for DVD ripping tasks and switches to pass 2 for better encoding. That means Handbrake will rip DVDs to MP4 fast on a Macbook or iMac equipped with a powerful video card.

 Handbrake can only rip DVDs that are homemade or lack copy protection. It cannot rip commercial DVDs without third party-tool like VLC or DVD decrypter libdvdcss, not to mention the Disney's newer protections. With its wide range of features, Handbrake might have a steeper learning curve for new users compared to simpler DVD rippers.

### How do I use Handbrake to rip a DVD on a Mac? 

1. Go to its official site to download and install the Mac DVD ripping freeware. Handbrake V1.7.3 works with Mac OS X 10.13 and later. If you're running on an Apple silicon based Mac, make sure the Handbrake is 1.4.0 or later.
2. Insert DVD disc into Mac's DVD drive and run Handbrake. Click the Source button to load the DVD. To rip protected DVDs, you need to [download libdvdcss for Handbrake](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to remove the CSS.
3. Click "Browse" to set where you want to save the output files. Then click "Presets" and select an output format.
4. What's the best setting for Handbrake ripping a DVD? Unless you aim for a target file size or speed, we recommend you use Constant Quality with an RF of \~21, Contant Frame Rate, Very Slow encode speed, High Encoder Profile, and 3.1 Encoder Level.
5. Apply other filters if needed. Once finished, click "RUN" to rip DVDs for free on Mac now.

Handbrake delivered great results when ripping my personal family DVDs. However, for protected DVDs, things got trickier. While installing libdvdcss through Homebrew allowed me to attempt ripping them, the process wasn't entirely reliable. Handbrake consistently failed to rip two specific movie DVDs with copy protection. Troubleshooting proved difficult since libdvdcss seemed to be working correctly. In the end, I turned to other Mac DVD rippers.

**Pros** 

* Handbrake provides tons of filters and DVD ripping setting options.
* Handbrake rips DVD on Mac freely with fast speed and high output quality.

**Cons** 

* Handbrake requires libdvdcss to rip protected DVDs. But Handbrake with libdvdcss support region codes and CSS only.
* Handbrake might not be fully optimized for Apple M1/2 Macs. This could result in slower ripping speeds and reliance on the CPU instead of the potentially faster GPU.
* The output formats are limited to MP4, MKV, and WebM.
* Handbrake doesn't have a built-in feature to merge multiple titles or episodes into a single file.

**Verdict:** Handbrake is the best DVD ripping software for Mac users who know how to adjust video settings, codecs, and various customization options to fine-tune the ripping process for specific needs. The copy protection will be a problem for Handbrake, but you can use MakeMKV together or download libdvdcss. 

##  No.5 - [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/)

* **Price:** Free
* **Compatibility:** x64 or ARM64 Mac OS X 10.7 or later; Windows XP or later, x86 or x64
* **Latest version:** 1.17.6 (January 20, 2024)

MakeMKV is among the top solutions to rip protected DVDs on Mac for free. It's an easy & free DVD/Blu-ray ripper for Mac, Windows, and Linux. MakeMKV remuxes the movie content from DVD MPEG2 to MKV without affecting the quality, reserving all video/audio tracks and subtitles with meta-information. That also means the whole DVD to MKV converting is pretty fast. Therefore, MakeMKV is your premium choice to backup your movie collection on your hard drive, NAS, or USB. 

However, the output MKV files tend to be really big in size. Normally, a DVD MKV movie takes 2-8 GB on the hard drive and a Blu-ray movie takes 30 GB. This is not good especially when you import the DVD movie into iPhone, iPad, devices with limited storage. That being said, you can reduce the file size by encoding it in Handbrake, with the final size in the range of 700MB to 1.5GB per DVD.

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

MakeMKV typically rips a DVD in about 20 minutes, so you only need to check in every 20 minutes to start ripping another DVD. Then just set up a queue of your ripped DVDs (in MKV format) and let your computer handle the rest. With this MakeMKV and Handbrake workflow, you can have 3-4 DVDs per hour ripped to your Mac hard drive.

### How do I rip a DVD on Mac with MakeMKV? 

1. Free download MakeMKV on Mac. It's completely free to rip a DVD disc to Mac during the beta-testing phase, and if you want to decrypt a Blu-Ray disc, you will need to pay $50.
2. Open the software and insert the disk. It accepts both DVD and Blu-Ray discs. Then click "Open Disc" to load the information.
3. MakeMKV will scan and identify the titles correctly and pop up a list of disk chapters. Choose the chapter, normally the longest and biggest title.
4. Select a folder on Mac to save the output MKV files and click "Make MKV". It shows a fast DVD to digital processing speed on Mac, with an average of 30 minutes to rip Blu-ray disc. The output MKV keeps high video and audio quality, but **the MKV file is enormous** (6.73GB MKV file for a 7.84GB DVD in our test).

![convert protected DVD on Mac free](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/makemkv-700.jpg) 

 MakeMKV

**Pros** 

* MakeMKV can copy a DVD to MKV on Mac with original video, audio, and subtitle tracks without quality loss.
* MakeMKV supports both encrypted Blu-ray discs and DVDs.
* MakeMKV offers fast speed as it only remuxes DVD data to MKV without re-encoding.

**Cons** 

* MakeMKV doesn't support GPU. This may result in high CPU usage and take a long time to finish the rip.
* MakeMKV rips DVD to MKV only, which is large in size and not playable in Apple apps such as iTunes or iDevices.
* There are no options to configure the video and video settings.

**Verdict:** MakeMKV's focus on preserving the original quality makes it the best Mac DVD ripper for users who prioritize creating high-quality, uncompressed backups of their DVD and Blu-ray collections.

##  No.9 - Disk Utility

* **Price:** Free
* **Compatibility:** all macOS systems
* **Latest version:** N/A

Although it's not the best option for ripping DVDs, Disk Utility can be used as a DVD ripper for Mac. If you just want to rip a few handmade DVDs for simpler playback or backup, you don't need to look for or download additional software because it comes pre-installed on all Mac machines. Even novice users will find it straightforward to navigate thanks to its user-friendly layout.

However, Disk Utility lacks advanced features commonly found in dedicated Mac DVD ripping software. As a result, you won't be able to choose which audio, video, or subtitle tracks to use while the file is being ripped. More so than other rippers, it is slower. It can manage tiny DVDs rather well, but larger or more complicated discs could be difficult for it to handle. 

Furthermore, if you encounter a copy-protected DVD, you'll need additional software or tools to bypass the encryption before using Disk Utility for ripping. 

**How do I rip a DVD on Mac with Disk Utility?** 

1. Insert the DVD into your Mac's DVD drive. Open "Disk Utility". You can find it in the "Utilities" folder, which is located within the "Applications" folder.
2. In Disk Utility, you will see a list of drives and volumes on the left-hand side. Select the DVD that you want to rip from the list. Click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the screen and select "New Image" and then "DVD/CD Master". This will create a disk image of the DVD.
3. Choose a location on your Mac where you want to save the disk image file. You can also choose the desired file name for the disk image. Make sure to select a location with enough storage space. Adjust the image format to "DVD/CD master" and the encryption to "none".
4. Click the "Save" button to start creating the disk image. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the DVD and the speed of your Mac. Once the disk image is created, you can eject the DVD from your Mac by right-clicking on its icon and selecting "Eject".

##  No.13 - [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/)

* **Price:** Free
* **Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, and Linux
* **Latest version:** 6.1.1 (December 31, 2023)

FFmpeg is a powerful, free and open-source command-based project used to handle videos, including ripping DVDs on Mac. FFmpeg supports most video formats, from the most obscure ancient formats up to the latest ones. The libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice, libswscale and libswresample libraries contained in it can satisfy any needs when ripping a DVD on Mac. 

However, the command lines require a steep learning curve, making FFmpeg an unfriendly choice for beginners. For advanced users, you can simply brew install ffmpeg GUI on your Mac and input a command line to do many flexible tasks. For example, to rip a DVD on Mac with FFmpeg, browse for the DVD files in the Finder and get the .vob file name you want to convert in the VIDEO\_TS folder:

To rip DVD to MP4:  
_ffmpeg -i concat:VTS\_02\_1.VOB\\|VTS\_02\_2.VOB\\|VTS\_02\_3.VOB\\|VTS\_02\_4.VOB\\|VTS\_02\_5.VOB -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -codec:a libvo\_aacenc -ab 128 -codec:v libx264 -vpre libx264-ipod640 movie.mp4_

To rip DVD to H.265:

* It's very easy to combine multiple DVD titles and episodes using FFmpeg concatenate commands.

* FFmpeg, as a command line tool, is more error-prone than other GUI free DVD rippers for Mac.
* FFmpeg can be a bit difficult to get started for a beginner in audio/video processing.

**Verdict:** If you're comfortable with command lines and want a free, highly customizable DVD ripping solution on Mac, you can try ffmpeg. Note that it doesn't support protected DVDs.

### Q1\. Is It Legal to Rip DVDs on Mac?

Many users who want to space-shift or format-shirt their legally purchased DVD or Blu-ray discs are often concerned about the legality of DVD ripping. The fact is, currently it is considered illegal to rip copyrighted DVDs in the US, even if you bought the DVDs yourself. Some other countries have already made it legal. In practice, as the DVD conversion happens locally on your computer, you won't get prosecuted or caught if you don't distribute the digital copies. However, you're highly suggested to obey the law where you live. [Check if it's legal to rip copy-protected DVDs in your country.](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

### Q2\. Can I Rip a DVD to My Mac with Mac Build-in App? 

Yes, as long as the DVD is unprotected. Mac's built-in app Disk Utility is able to rip a homemade DVD to an ISO image file. However, you can't use it to rip a protected DVD on Mac. 

This is because almost all DVD movies or TV shows bought or rented are technically copyrighted and DVD rips will inevitably involve breaking DVD copy protections, e.g. the Content Scramble System. Such action is currently unlawful in the US and UK. Apple is of course unwilling to set against law or money in consideration of continuous cooperation with U.S. studios for iTunes movies. Therefore, there is no built-in method to rip DVDs to Mac. This makes it a sense to download a third-party free DVD ripper for Mac instead.

### Q3\. How do I Rip a Protected DVD on a Mac?

For DVDs encoded with CSS or region code, you can install libdvdcss on Mac or windows to crack the [DVD copy protection](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and then rip the DVD with Handbrake or VLC.

Chances are DVDs from major film studios like Disney, Sony, Warner Bros., etc. often impose strong protections on DVDs. These discs are deliberately placed with bad information and hide the true titles. As a result, 99% of DVD rippers for Mac will go awry like DVD won't load, encounter a large number of tracks with the same runtime, show impossibly 40GB or more of data but output just several KB.To rip the severely protected DVDs, the workaround is to resort to MacX DVD ripper that is built-in a DVD analysis scheme to crack Sony ARccOS, Disney X-project DRM, UOP, 99-titles, and more.

### Q4\. What Is the Best Format to Rip DVD to Mac?

Apple apps such as Mac's default player QuickTime, Photos, and Keynote work with many video formats, among which MP4 and MOV are well-known with the best compatibility. When digitizing DVDs with a free DVD ripper for Mac, many users are at a loss whether to choose MP4 or MOV. 

**\* MP4** \- Both MP4 and MOV use lossy video compression to sacrifice minimal quality for file size. MP4 is popular for streaming over the internet and playable on Mac, Windows, and almost all media players, say VLC, 5KPlayer, QT, etc. But P-frames or B-frames in MP4 makes it difficult to edit.

**\* MOV** \- As MOV is originally developed by Apple for its QuickTime player, it's much friendlier in the Apple ecosystem. MOV contains one or more tracks, meant to store each type of data including audio, video, subtitle, etc in a hierarchical structure, which is good for editing. So for Mac computers, converting DVD to digital MOV for Mac QuickTime is more preferred than MP4.

### Q5\. Is it Possible to Rip Scratched DVD on Mac?

DVDs are too fragile, that's why we need to back up the DVD collection. If your discs are already damaged or scratched, there are measures to remedy them.

* **For a few scratches on the surface**, polish the surface with cotton balls and abrasive white toothpaste or Brasso polish. You need to polish across the grain and don't do it in circular direction. This needs patience.
* **For deep scratches and severe damages**, you can take the damaged disk to a local DVD store with a polishing machine or other places like Phoenix to resurface the badly scuffed disc. This will cost a couple of dollars. Or if the standalone DVD player with an error-recovery scheme can ignore the errors and play the DVD, you can capture the movie with a DV. But this will lost the selectable audio, subtitles streams, and original menus.

**Note:** if the program refuses to rip a well-conditioned DVD with an error stating that there is a bad sector, it's because the DVD is protected by a copy protection scheme from Sony named ARccOS. The system deliberately mixes corrupted sectors with the correct ones to mislead [DVD copy software](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

### Q6\. How long does it take to rip a DVD on Mac?

The DVD ripping speed mainly depends on factors like the CPU performance, the read speed of the DVD-ROM drive, USB transfer speed, the contents of the movie, the ripping ability of the software, etc. That means more CPU cores, RAM and a specialized video encoding module in graphics cards, and an advanced drive, all make it faster to rip a DVD. However, on the same computer, some DVD rippers can take advantage of the GPU, such as Intel QSV, Nividia Cuda/Nvenc, and AMD to speed up the rip. Free Mac DVD rippers that support GPU acceleration are MacX DVD Ripper and Handbrake.
