### Magnifying part of the screen

Once you click on 'Continue,' you will see a part of the screen in zoom-in mode. You must remember to hover the cursor in the correct area of your screen that you require in a magnifying manner.

### Increase or decrease the whole screen

* You need to download the Zoom App for Chromebook.
* After you download the Zoom App, you have to create a Google Meet ID
