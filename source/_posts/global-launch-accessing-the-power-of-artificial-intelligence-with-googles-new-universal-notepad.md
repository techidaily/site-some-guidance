## Global Launch: Accessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence with Google's New Universal Notepad

In the new generative AI era, Google has a mixed track record. The company has its Gemini AI bot, which had a rocky start but is currently a capable, albeit still kind of lacking chatbot, even with a premium version. On the other hand, the company's AI Overviews were telling people to eat rocks and glue. Now, yet another AI product is making its way to everyone, and we await to see whether it's useful or hilarious.

 Google has announced a major upgrade to [NotebookLM](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/1722997973389-troubleshooting-guide-fixing-windows-spotlight-issues-on-windows-11/), its AI-powered research and writing assistant, and expanded its availability to over 200 countries and territories. The upgrade includes the integration of Gemini 1.5 Pro, Google's latest language model, which enhances NotebookLM's capabilities in understanding and processing information. One of the key improvements is the chatbot's newly-gained ability to process various file types, including Google Slides and web URLs, in addition to Google Docs, PDFs, and text files. NotebookLM can now also analyze images, charts, and diagrams within documents, providing citations when relevant.

 Another significant feature is the 'Notebook guide,' which helps users summarize and organize their sources into formats like FAQs, briefing documents, or study guides. Inline citations are now more helpful, directly linking users to the supporting passages within the original sources for easy fact-checking. The tool itself looks pretty cool and it could have the potential to help you out with various kinds of assignments.

 At the same time, this is just now making it to users worldwide, so you probably don't want to check it out straight awayâ€”at least not with serious, sensitive work. As it has been evidenced, Google's AI products need some actual real-world usage and tweaking before they can actually be reliably useful. It happened to Gemini back when the chatbot was called [Bard](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-gameye-and-webcam-recordings/), and it happened to [AI overviews](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-top-free-video-editing-tools-for-gamers/), so we wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing hilarious/weird output from NotebookLM over the coming days.

 If you want to check it out, however, make sure to go into the official [NotebookLM website](https://notebooklm.google.com/). Just make sure to take everything it says with a grain of salt for now.
