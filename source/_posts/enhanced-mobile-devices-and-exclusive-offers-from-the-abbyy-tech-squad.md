Everyone wants to be one of a kind. In today’s Mobile Monday we’ll give a hint how to change theme on iPhone and Android smartphone. And we’ll show you an app that helps to serve a table for any holiday.

## **iOS Tip: How to Install a New Theme**

We’ll start with a useful trick for those of you who like to change themes and backgrounds on your device. Not all of us are prepared to jailbreak our phone to be able to replace app icons, but, luckily, there’s an easy and safe way to do this using the Safari browser. It’s called [iSkin](http://iskin.tooliphone.net/), and will work both for iPhones and iPads.

![iOS Install a New Theme iSkin app](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26145/lockate-9-e1514208256999.jpg)

Here’s how it works:

1. On your iOS device, launch Safari and open [iSkin](http://iskin.tooliphone.net/). Scroll down a bit and tap **Browse all themes**.
2. Select any theme that takes your fancy.![ios app iskin all themes set](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26146/d31ed2c0d4f86ff76e162434f1ff0d0f-e1514208302177.png)
3. Open the selected theme and tap the **Application icons** command. You will see a long list of icons for popular apps. Select the apps whose names you want to modify and give them new names. These new names will be used on the Springboard screen. IMPORTANT! Be sure to select icons that have an identical background color. When you are done, tap **Install icons** and wait a few seconds.![set theme iphone ios Application icons](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26147/6b20dd3c3e26f87f69a112b721bab364-e1514208376238.png)
4. A profile setup menu will open. Tap **Install** end enter your master password. If a message appears saying that the profile is unsigned, confirm that want to install it anyway.
5. When the installation is complete, tap **Done**. Then tap **Home** to go back to the main screen.
6. Now you need to install the gradient background for the icons (its color depends on the selected theme). Open the [iSkin](http://iskin.tooliphone.net/) website. In the menu of your theme, tap **Home screens** and select the wallpaper colour that matches the background colour of your icons.![Home screens app iscreen themes iphone](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26148/b9f95dd95fab97f74674edc83799f021-e1514208438247.png)
7. On the page that opens, long-tap the appropriate gradient picture. Select **Save Image**, then open the Photos app and set the saved image as the wallpaper of the home screen (don’t forget to do the same for the lock screen as well).![set a theme screen iphone ios](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26149/cjeamswxeaavv9q-e1514208472223.jpg)

On the [iSkin](http://iskin.tooliphone.net/) website, you’ll find dozens of themes and icons. You can also create your own for any app using the icustom.tooliphone.net service. No, no, don’t thank us.

## **Android Tip: How to Install a New Theme**

On Android, it’s much, much easier to install a new theme than on iOS. The most straightforward way to do this is to download a new theme from the Play Market. Just open the Play Market on your device and type in, say, “theme” in the search field.

If you are a confident Android user, you can download a theme from some third-party resource using any app installer (e.g. AppInstaller). Simply download any theme you like onto your device and complete these steps:

1. Open Settings and allow the operating system to install apps from unknown sources.
2. Copy the downloaded \*.apk theme file onto the SD card plugged into your device.
3. Start the app installer, wait while it scans the SD card for apps, select the \*.apk file containing the new theme, and follow the instructions of the app installer.
