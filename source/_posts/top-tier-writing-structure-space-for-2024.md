## Top-Tier Writing Structure Space

If you've ever experienced writer's block, you're probably not alone. Most writers, in fact, experience "block" at some point in their careers. Writer's block can manifest itself in a variety of ways, including procrastination, a lack of creativity, and even the feeling that there is nothing to say.

But don't worry! There still are a lot of approaches to getting past this frustrating stumbling block and back into your creative groove. The world of screenwriting is vast and ever-changing. To get your scripts out there for consideration as a screenwriter, you must keep up with the latest trends.

We've compiled a comprehensive list of script writing software and websites. Analyze these options, choose what works best for you, and begin writing your screenplay right away.

### 2\. [Logline It.](https://logline.it/)

### 4\. [Screenwriting.io.](https://screenwriting.io/)

![screenwriting.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-4.jpg)

John August, the author of Go, Charlie's Angels, and Big Fish has created one of the best online screenwriting websites for answering basic questions about the craft and business of writing.

Enter any question into the search bar and, nine times out of ten, you'll find an answer.

## Part 2\. Best 5 free websites to download scripts

When I want to see how a more seasoned or, let's be honest, a better writer than me attacks a story, I usually want to read their script. I want to know how they follow the story on the page and for that... I need to see the script.

But since I don't work in a studio, I must find them online and the search can be exhausting. So, what are the best websites for downloading movies and TV scripts?

Let's go through them together.

### 1\. [IMSDB– Internet Movie Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

This is the first place I go for scripted stuff. They have an extensive catalog and have proven to be a valuable resource for researching film crews, actors, and trivia. IMSDB is equally useful for those looking for screenplays of all kinds and genres, which they have listed in categories.

![imsdb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-5.jpg)

### 2\. [Go Into the Story](https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/)

![go into the story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-6.jpg)

I'm a huge fan of Scott Myers. He gives everything to the writer. Go Into the Story is the official blog for The **_Black List,_** the screenwriting community known for its annual list of the top ten unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. There is always a bank of scripts that you can filter.

### 3\. [Simply Scripts](https://www.simplyscripts.com/)

![simply scripts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-7.jpg)

Simply Scripts has a large and diverse library that includes Tennessee Williams' plays, classics, and even non-English screenplays. It's also constantly updated, so the most recent scripts are always available.

### 4\. [Screenplays For You](https://sfy.ru/)

![screenplays for you](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-8.jpg)

Again, there is not much difference between these pages. You can search by genre here or alphabetically. They have it all.

### 5\. [The Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

![the screenplay database](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-9.jpg)

The script database is another useful resource with a large selection of scripts to choose from. If you're interested in a certain type of movie, the site also lets you search its library by genre, allowing you to browse the window displays and find something you didn't even know you were looking for.

## Part 3\. Best 5 free websites to grace your scripts

### 1\. [Go Into The Story](https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/)

![go into the story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-10.jpg)

Run by Scott Myers, the Go into The Story blog has been named “Best of the Best” by Writer's Digest magazine.

It covers business, art, and the everyday problems of a writer.

In addition to being an award-winning blog, Scott's blog is also one that we visit almost every day. It's a one-stop shop for interviews, advice, and answers to any reader questions.

### 2\. [John August](https://johnaugust.com/)

![john august](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-11.jpg)

Everyone seems to have advice about Hollywood, but who can you trust? John August is one of Hollywood's best screenwriters. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Big Fish and continues to work on major studio films such as Aladdin, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie's Angels.

John August's blog has become the place people go for screenwriting news and advice from someone who does it every day.

### 3\. [StudioBinder](https://www.studiobinder.com/)

![studiobinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-12.jpg)

Inspiration is half the battle in writing, but what if you hit writer's block and just can't move forward? The StudioBinder blog is dedicated to helping aspiring and experienced filmmakers achieve their dreams, but the StudioBinder platform is where you can shine.

It can help you not only inspire your script but also help you with production. Once you've finished writing your masterpiece, you can upload the script to StudioBinder. You can check the formatting of your script and even help the production by connecting with an assistant director to mark each of the elements of your story.

### 4\. [Internet Movie Script Database](https://imsdb.com/)

![internet movie script database](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-13.jpg)

If you're going to write screenplays for a career, you'd better get used to reading them. But professional scripts can be hard to find.

IMSDB is an extensive database of old and new works for you to browse. The website has new, old, and classic scripts for you to dissect and study.

Life is an endless journey of learning. And the site's vast inventory of scripts is a treasure trove for both new and seasoned writers.

You can learn about character development and how to create a solid story structure just by reading. New scripts are added every day, so chances are what you're looking for is inside.

### 5\. [The Black List](https://blcklst.com/)

![the black list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-14.jpg)

From the website, Blacklist is "...a closed network that connects script buyers, agents and screenwriters in one place". You can upload your script for a fee and then have users and readers rate it on a scale of 1-10\. It is a way to enter the digital age.

The Blacklist appropriated the term from the McCarthy era of the 1950s and has since become a place where industry figures vote on their favorite projects of the year.

It has since expanded to an online database where users can submit their scripts for coverage and be ranked among competitors.

## Part 4\. Make your scripts come true by using Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a video editing software that enables users to create amazing videos efficiently using a wide range of powerful editing tools.
