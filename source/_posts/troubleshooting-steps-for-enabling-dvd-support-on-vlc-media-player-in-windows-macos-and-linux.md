Libdvdcss is a library only for freeware and designed to help access DVDs without having to worrying about the decryption. With the help of Libdvdcss, users don't need to set the region of your DVD drive or to [remove region code from DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

### 7\. Other Solutions to VLC Won't Play Blu-ray DVDs 

Some users reported that when they played Blu ray discs in VLC, an error message said "Your input can't be opened: VLC is unable to open the MRL MRL 'dvd://D:\\'. Check the log for details". First, check for update and upgrade to the new version of VLC. And to solve VLC not playing Blu-ray DVDs and play encrypted Blu-ray DVDs in VLC, you need **keys database and AACS dynamic library**. Go to [VLC Libaacs](http://www.videolan.org/developers/libaacs.html) to download KEYDB.cfg, and libaacs.dall for Windows or libaacs.dylib for Mac. But it doesn't work for all regions and encryptions applied to Blu-rays. Or you can shift to another Blu-ray DVD player to have a try.
