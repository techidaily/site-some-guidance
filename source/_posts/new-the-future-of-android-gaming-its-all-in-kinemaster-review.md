## Part 1\. What is KineMaster App?

KineMaster is probably the best video editing software for mobile devices having unique features like Chroma key, video transitions, audio/video effects, and many more, which would help you to turn your imaginations into reality.

**Download:** you can download the app from [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster/id1223932558).

**Price:** One of the best advantages of KineMaster is that it is available in free and paid versions for its users, but the question arises here. What is the difference between them? Let us tell you if you are using its free version. There are a few restrictions like you cannot access highly advanced editing tools, popular filters, effects, stickers, etc. The biggest con among them is they will put their watermark on your videos, which may affect their looks. But if you are using their paid version, you have unlimited access to everything, and there will also be no watermark on your exported videos. Also, in its free version, you may face some ads, which will not be if you use its paid version. However, you can download its cracked version from [RevDl](https://www.revdl.com/kinemaster-pro-mod-apk-download9.html/)to get unlimited access to everything without ads.

Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well.
