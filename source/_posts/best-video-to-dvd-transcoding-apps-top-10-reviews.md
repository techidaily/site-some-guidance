Total video converter

**Review**: This EffectMatrix video to DVD converter's primary function is to convert video and audio files from one to another, which it does a great job. Yet, that's not the whole story. This second-ranking tool also allows you to process video from MKV, FLV etc. to DVD MPEG format and burn the video to DVDs. The DVD burning feature is definitely a huge boon for its customers. Of course, it's not perfect. See the objective review from en.softonic shows that it brings you converted files with low quality once in a while.

![AVS video converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/avs-converter.jpg) 

AVS video converter

**Review**: This program contains a respectable library of input and output profiles. You are allowed to convert video to DVD and convert video to Blu Ray format for later DVD burning. As for output profiles, apart from the DVD NTSC/PAL format, you have a mammoth selection to choose from, either the digital video audio formats like MOV, MP4, H.264, AVI, DixV, XviD or the mobile device profiles like iOS iPhone iPad iPod, Android Samsung Sony, etc. One thing to note is that the mobile device profiles don't cover the latest iOS Android flagship, just the common older gadgets.

![Free Video to DVD Converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/free-video-dvd-converter.jpg) 

Free Video to DVD Converter

**Review**: As the world-renowned freeware, this one will never let you down in video to DVD conversion mission. It excels in converting almost any video format to DVD MPEG-2 (720×480) format and burns them to a DVD disk, which is playable on any home DVD player. However, some users complain a lot on the bundled third party apps installation, which is aimed to help DVDVideoSoft's products further development. So if you really can't bear this, you can refuse the third party apps installation.

## 9\. Freemake Video Converter

* Size: 29.0 MB
* Label: Free Video Files to DVD transcoder, upload video to YouTube straight away

Freemake Video Converter

**Review**: Not only does Freemake Video Converter work as an amazing video to video converter, it also performs as a mighty monster in video footage to DVD processing field. Apply it to free convert MP4 to DVD, FLV to DVD, MKV to DVD or MOV to DVD, all piece of cake, with 250+ formats supported. However, after our test, it ranks near the bottom, because it takes a rather longer time than the others in the whole conversion. So the video to DVD conversion speed is the one Freemake should take more efforts on.

**Review**: Any Video Converter Freeware is an apt name for this video to DVD converter app, because it truly does what its name implies-convert any video. It does convert video among SD and HD videos and also plays a perfect role. It converts MP4 to DVD, MOV to DVD and even YouTube to DVD format.
