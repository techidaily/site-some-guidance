## The Blueprint to Acquire Clean Images

Stock images are a valuable resource for any creator. Most companies use them to advertise their merchandise and communicate their brand image. In addition, several stock photo providers allow you to use their creative assets for commercial purposes, such as Unsplash, Shutterstock, and Pixabay. Unfortunately, some do not allow you to download stock images without a watermark. This is because of the unique licenses they offer with their content.

Keep reading to learn more about downloading stock images without watermarks. In addition, you will discover if it is OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use.

## Part1:Why not use stock photos with watermarks?

![watermarks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-1.jpg)

This is because it infringes on the image's copyright, which can land you in legal trouble. In addition, stock photo contributors can choose to include watermarks in their images as a way of copyrighting their work. As such, they can command royalty payments from the stock photograph website and other users who download their images.

In addition, the stock photos watermark informs other users who to contact when they want to use your images for personal and commercial use. Therefore, they can sue you for extra damages if you use their images without purchasing the rights.

Another reason why it is not OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use is that it looks unprofessional. Typically, stock photo watermarks cover the middle of the photo, making it near unusable for potential copyright violators. In addition, using a watermarked stock photo for your messaging can harm your brand. This is because it indicates to your audience that you are cheap and do not appreciate other people's hard work.

## Part2: How to get watermark-free stock photos?

Now that using stock photos with watermarks can land you in trouble, how can you get watermark-free stock photos for commercial use? Here are some of the methods you should consider.

### Method 1: Go to Free stock sites

Stock photos are images you can use in your personal and commercial works, such as to create your logo or for marketing purposes. Although some sites require you to pay to use their content, there are plenty more that offer their images for free. Below are some of the sites you should check out.

### Method 2: Make good use of paid stock sites

1. **iStock has an even more free policy.**

Another paid stock site that offers even better freebies is iStock. The site offers free stock images, illustrations and video clips with the same benefits as your paid downloads. These include:

      * Flexible usage rights allow you to include the images in your personal and commercial work.
      * Professionally vetted content to ensure high-quality and that it meets all legal requirements for free use.

1. **Adobe Stock**

Alternatively, you can get stock images without a watermark from Adobe Stock. Although the site is fairly new compared to the ones above, it now ranks as one of the creative industry's top stock content sites. In addition, the site hosts millions of high-quality curated and royalty-free content from thousands of contributors.

![adobe stock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-4.jpg)

Currently, the site offers a 30-day trial to all new users. The following is what you can expect after registering a new user account on Adobe Stock:

      * You can download 10 images for free during your trial.
      * The site will only charge you after the trial period ends. Then, you will need to pay $29.99 to download 10 assets monthly.
      * You can cancel your account risk-free within thirty days of registering for an Adobe Stock account.

### Method 3: Shoot your stock photos

You can also get stock photos without watermarks by shooting your photos. Unfortunately, not everyone can shoot professional photos worthy of commercial use. However, here are some tips to help you get the right stock image for commercial use.

* Have the correct light conditions to increase your image detail.
* Use your camera's auto-adjust settings for the best image quality.
* Take multiple shots to increase your choices for the best photo.
* Get signed releases from your subjects to prevent future legal trouble.
* Share your photos on stock photo sites to allow you access to more images.

### Method 4: Use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get free stock media resources

![get free stock media resources](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-5.jpg)

You can also use Wondershare Filmora to get free stock media resources for your commercial creations. The video editing software features Filmstock, a library of stock content, including images, videos, royalty-free sound effects, and music.

In addition, Filmora integrates Unsplash.com, pixabay.com, and many other stock media sites into the software. Here is how you can access free stock media resources through Filmstock.

* Launch the Filmora Video Editor from your device.
* Click on **New Project** to access the project workspace.
* Tap on the **Effects** tab and press the **Filmstock** button.

* Once logged in, you will have access to the creative asset library. In addition, you can access the free content by changing the **Library** type to Free from the **Filmora Effects** page.

Unfortunately, all free content you download from Filmstock includes the Filmora tag. In addition, you should not remove the watermark with editing software because it violates copyright law. Instead, you can avoid legal liability by purchasing the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Business Plan.
