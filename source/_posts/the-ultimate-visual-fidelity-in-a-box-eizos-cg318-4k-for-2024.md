This automatic setting helps to provide efficient results as compared to other competitive models and it will also save much time of users.

When this sensor is not in use then it automatically swings back to its normal position.

 Users can set schedules calibration timings for this monitor and when that schedule needs to run then your standby monitor will wake up automatically and it will spend few minutes for automatic calibration. Once this task is completed then it normally goes back to sleep mode.

The build in sensor ensures perfect optimization for calibrated screen. You will find its Color Edge Navigator Software tool easy to setup and it can assist users for their video and photography needs. It managed automatic switching of desired color specific features as per need of current project running on screen.
