## Unveiling the Potential of NZXT Funktion 2 in Gaming - Comprehensive Review Insights.

### Key Takeaways

* The NZXT FUNCTION 2 keyboard has optical switches and customizable actuation points for a fast and responsive gaming experience.
* The keyboard features customizable RGB lighting and durable keycaps that can withstand heavy use.
* The NZXT CAM software allows for extensive customization options and is compatible with other NZXT hardware.

 NZXT just launched two new keyboards: The full-size [NZXT Function 2](https://nzxt.sjv.io/c/156932/1728191/20004?subId1=htgfunctiontworeview&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Ffunction-2) and the compact [NZXT Function 2 MiniTKL](https://www.amazon.com/NZXT-Tenkeyless-Adjustable-Double-Shot-Hot-Swappable/dp/B0CST2HK9G/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3g7dAvpUw7YsDjo-urVyTNIGs1JM-ycntAPnRfLiO3T5iCrIt-2EkhN1wdXGAKViz%5Fnyhbp2DiQNMI7ZngTvHcbz7HJ7Pn0YJCVMvngsvTSpn7pDp-p8nhKloK5f%5FMlEjouYmYazpv9rGCuswHcL3sWf-oCM4IjYAy68CwFOVe8DsgiiXaCip%5FN9cuylBkF5OukGRkUIPXMSasxInuxKhOkIJHRaFl8rJ73ata-XVQ8.5Rh0QskKMs31EIlY7H8kHiglyRYtszGCRXt1pjBBxGE&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=nzxt%2Bfunction%2B2&qid=1708568070&sr=8-1&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002034&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnzxt-function-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority). The Function 2 keyboards retain the high build quality of the original Function line, but they represent a major update. The Function 2 swaps the older model's Gateron Red mechanical switches for linear, optical mechanical switches. It also has a significantly faster polling rate (8,000Hz to the original's 1,000Hz), more durable keycaps, and more sound-dampening features, all of which make for a compelling keyboard.

 Before I dig into the Function 2’s keys, let’s take a quick tour of the board. I tested the full-size Function 2, which includes a number pad.

 If you’re wondering who _wouldn’t_ want a full-size keyboard, the answer is: People who want their hands closer together while gaming. Lopping the number pad off a keyboard creates a compact keyboard form factor(often called a tenkeyless) that lets you keep your hands closer together while using the WASD keys and the mouse. If that's what you're looking for, the [Function 2 MiniTKL](https://www.amazon.com/NZXT-Tenkeyless-Adjustable-Double-Shot-Hot-Swappable/dp/B0CST2HK9G/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=38XUJNKLFP7DK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3g7dAvpUw7YsDjo-urVyTNIGs1JM-ycntAPnRfLiO3T5iCrIt-2EkhN1wdXGAKViz%5Fnyhbp2DiQNMI7ZngTvHcbz7HJ7Pn0YJCVMvngsvTSpn7pDp-p8nhKloK5f%5FMlEjouYmYazpv9rGCuswHcL3sWf-oCM4IjYAy68CwFOVe8DsgiiXaCip%5FN9cuylBkF5OukGRkUIPXMSasxInuxKhOkIJHRaFl8rJ73ata-XVQ8.5Rh0QskKMs31EIlY7H8kHiglyRYtszGCRXt1pjBBxGE&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=nzxt%2Bfunction%2B2&qid=1708567751&sprefix=%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-1&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002034&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnzxt-function-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is aimed at you.

 The first thing I want to point out is the volume roller. I liked the roller's position because I could reach it with my left hand without moving my fingers far from the keys. It sits on the edge of the board, by the ESC key. I change the volume often, especially when I'm playing a first-person shooter or chatting with friends.

 That left edge has buttons that let you mute, lock windows, and adjust the board’s lighting. Each of the buttons has a corresponding status light nearby. I like these buttons for the same reason I like the volume roller: I can reach them quickly and I don't need to use my mouse hand.

 The Function 2 also has four profile keys (the first four function keys), so you can quickly switch keyboard profiles. You can create those custom profiles using the NZXT CAM software.

## **Smooth, Adjustable Key Switches**

 NZXT designed the Function 2 to be very customizable–but also playable out of the box. It has new optical switches, which use light (instead of metal clips) to sense when you press the keys. The switches, which are purple, have a 40-gram actuation force and an adjustable actuation point (the point the key senses a key press). Using the CAM software, you can set the actuation point to 1mm or 1.5mm.

 I typed with both 1mm and 1.5mm actuation and was a little surprised by how much the .5mm travel distance mattered. If I were to type for long periods on the Function 2, I would set it to the 1.5mm setting, as I had better accuracy on it. But for most gaming situations, I’d take that faster 1mm press any day.

 NXZT puts the key response time at 0.2ms and the polling rate at 8,000Hz. That makes for a very fast keyboard that should hold its own against the other top boards from the big names in the market. The board also features N-key rollover, which is important for gaming.

 The Function 2 has sound-dampening foam to prevent overly-loud keystrokes. As someone who likes clacky keyboards, I find the Function 2's sound to be noticeable but tame. You aren't likely to annoy other people in the room with it.

 When it comes to key customization, you can swap out the default, pre-lubricated switches for other ones. NZXT gets you started with two sets of different switches (four each). The red switches are a little more resistant, with a 45-gram actuation force, while the gold switches need only 35 grams.

 I tried both of the extra switch sets in the WASD keys and played several games, including my standby, "Left4Dead2." The red switches didn't help me in those spots, with their stronger actuation forces, but I enjoyed being able to quickly press the gold switches. Adding the extra key switches is a nice touch.

 The Function 2’s keys are tough and should stand you in good stead for a long time, thanks to the double-shot PBT. The RGB LED lighting shines through the letters and numbers on the keycaps and creates a gorgeous, multicolor glow on the base of the board. You can customize that lighting in the CAM software.

## **Simple, Quality Accessories** 

![NZXT Function 2 keyboard plugged in](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/the-function-2-plugged-injpg_53489593990_o-2.jpg)

 The box includes some worthwhile accessories, including a long, 6.56-foot data cable with a braided sleeve. The PC end is USB-A and the other end plugs into a USB-C port near the upper-left part of the Function 2.

 The accessories package also includes separate tools for pulling key caps and key switches. Naturally, both of these are in NZXT’s purple. I like the magnetic wrist rest, which snaps right into place.

 Once you download and install the free [NZXT CAM](https://nzxt.com/software/cam) software, you have a boatload of options for customizing your keyboard. You can adjust the RGB lighting, create those profiles that I mentioned earlier, and choose a polling rate.

 The software is easy to use. I'll admit that I'm a sucker for good RGB lighting, so I enjoyed testing out the software's lighting features. I switched the mode from Base to Reactive, which made the color ripple outward when I pressed any key.

 CAM lets you choose between the 1mm and 1.5mm actuation points. It has images of the switches so you can see what the difference is between the two points and make an educated choice. This section of the software also lets you adjust the polling rate from 125Hz to 8,000Hz and set keyboard macros.

 If you have other NZXT hardware, you'll be able to use the same CAM software to handle their settings, as well. And you don't need NZXT hardware to use the PC Monitoring feature, which shows you the load for components like the CPU, GPU, and memory, among others.

## **Should You Buy the NZXT Function 2?** 

![NZXT Function 2 keyboard with keycaps removed.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/the-function-2-with-keycaps-removedjpg_53489179946_o-2.jpg)

 The [NZXT Function 2](https://nzxt.sjv.io/c/156932/1728191/20004?subId1=htgfunctiontworeview&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Ffunction-2) is a win. The RGB lighting is gorgeous, the board is sturdy, and the optical switches are sensitive. And because it's a full-size board, you can use the Function 2 for non-gaming tasks without missing the number pad. The NZXT Function 2 isn't as wallet-friendly as, say, the [Keychron C3 Pro Wired Mechanical Keyboard](https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-transferring-tunes-between-platforms/), but delivers on build quality, customization, and smooth key presses.
