Transforming Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management Utilizing an Advanced Analytical Technique 

Introduction to transforming revenue cycle management Revenue cycle management has been changing with the evolving way that patients pay for services. Due to changes with government regulations, a higher percentage of people are paying more for their care and coverage. Due to increasing cost in services, patients expect a high level of care and transparency from their providers. In order to meet these expectations, healthcare providers are being pressured to decrease inefficiencies and costs while increasing the level of patient satisfaction. Hospitals have been struggling to provide the level of care patients expect while remaining a profitable facility. In 2017, the American Hospital Financial Association Financial Factsheet reported that since the year 2000, hospitals have been burdened with more than $576 billion in uncompensated bills. A large portion of the uncompensated amount is attributed to the processes of collecting payments. in uncompensated hospital bills MORE THAN $576 billion Many things like claims reimbursement and high- deductible health plans are continuously adding to the already complicated process of collecting payments. This large gap in revenue and costs has contributed to the 30-a-year pace of facilities closing nationally. It is up to the providers to find a solution that both decreases inefficiencies and reduces costs while also increasing patient satisfaction. Healthcare organizations need to focus on not only improving the quality of care, but also assessing the office hours and scheduling times that are being offered. Many patients are unable to take time away from work during the appointment slots that are available. Healthcare organizations need to start assessing patient wants and needs and providing more convenient access to care. 

The challenges in the healthcare market are requiring a tighter integration of systems and better management of revenue cycle processes in order to improve performance and quality of care. Providers are finding that the time and effort required by process discovery and benchmarking of the as-is state prior to re-engineering processes already in place requires money and time that are often not available. These re-engineering processes commonly fail and therefore result in the waste of these resources. The revenue cycle needs strategies that enable agility and resiliency to the ongoing changes to the healthcare industry. One giant leap for providers in revenue cycle optimization is to bridge the gap between payments and billing. Having a better understanding of how these systems work together and how revenue cycle processes are executed as-is can help to identify and eliminate bad process behaviors. Understanding the root cause of revenue cycle waste and inefficiencies will assist in the better management of revenue cycle processes. 

Adopting advanced analytical techniques Advanced analytics are imperative for healthcare leaders, not only to conduct analysis on historical process information and identify claims denials, but also to leverage the process-related data using predictive intelligence. Some highlights of how advanced process analytics will help: Reduce bad debt write-offs and days receivables outstanding (DRO) — Make decisions proactively and ensure that steps are never missed, and that deadlines and clinical requirements are followed so that providers are paid quickly and efficiently 100 percent of the time. Catch errors sooner — With deadline analysis, analyze the number of events that comply with deadlines. With monitoring, ensure that deadlines are met through preemptive alerts that deadlines are about to be missed. Reduce workload from providers to focus on patient care — Pay-for-performance has stressed quality of care, creating pressures to decrease the number of patients experiencing bad outcomes. Predictive and prescriptive analytics capabilities allow for a greater level of confidence with patient care. Automatically understanding process execution — Point-and-click analysis functionality allows for healthcare providers to easily identify improvement opportunities to reduce cost, increase revenue, and boost efficiency through the entire revenue cycle. 1 2 3 4
