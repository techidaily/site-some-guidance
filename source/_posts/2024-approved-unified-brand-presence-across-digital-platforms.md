### Never Reach out brand that you don’t believe in

Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.

Bigger the following, easier it is to get sponsorship. Just focus on your goal and don’t be disappointed you might get what your dream of in the perfect time.
