**Step 3: Set demuxing settings**  
If your disc is a commercial DVD with protection imposed, don't forget to check the Safe Mode on the right bottom part of the interface, which is designed to remove any tough DVD copy protections and ensure a smooth DVD data extracting.  
Note: Ripping protected DVD is not allowed in some countries, so is DVD video/audio demux. However it is widely believed that you can use the content of the DVD you legally owned for personal use only. You'd better check your copyright law first.
