"iPhone iPad users still cringe in horror of data erasing when having to sync media file with their computers, just in case of a hard drive crash. On the other hand, they blame for no way of exporting their files to Macs as a backup with iTunes, especially when they need to switch to a new phone, free up their storage space or set about an iOS upgrade." said Jack, CEO of MacXDVD Software. "But we are proud to say that these three can be fixed with MacX MediaTrans, which can backup and manage iPhone iPad iPod users' resources, without erasing, dumping or cluttering their media files."
