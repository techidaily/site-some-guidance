#### What should my video brightness be?

The brightness of your videos should always be medium. Too much or too little brightness can make the video look unnatural, and viewers may be able to see details in the video. Also, too much brightness will cause color saturation problems.

The brightness is measured by calculating the average value of all color channels in the frame. This can be used to adjust the contrast and brightness by increasing or decreasing this value.
