**Step 2:** Once you are done with the first step then simply open your Window Media Player and move to the Library Mode. Now switch to play, then Lyrics, captions and finally you will reach at subtitles. Hit this option and choose “On if Available”. The same option is also available in the Now Playing Mode where you simply need to right click and this option will appear in drop down menu.

Simply install codec from this source; no need to work on configuration settings. Note that these codecs must be installed from a trusted source so that malware or virus attacks can be avoided.
