## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

![subRip subtitle file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-19.jpg)

### 2\. SSA

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.

### 3\. XML

This subtitle format contains encoding, duration, and content of subtitles like this,

### 4\. TTML

This is an XML-based format that has a somewhat complicated look with <> appearing in many places.

Now that you know have seen a comparison between different subtitle formats, you must agree that SRT is the best of all, without a doubt.

Therefore, it’s time to see how we can convert these subtitle formats into SRT without much trouble.

## How to Convert SSA to SRT

Now that we know how to convert SSA subtitle format to SRT format, let’s convert XML format into SRT this time.

## How to Convert XML to SRT

As XML subtitle format is used in marker language, so many video players don't support this type of format. While most of the video players easily support SRT files that are specialized for videos and movies.

Therefore, to convert XML subtitles to SRT, here are the steps you need to follow.

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).

Step2 Now click on the “Upload” option and select the XML subtitle from your device.

Step3 After that, select the “SubRip (.srt)” from the middlebox.

Step4 Once done, hit the “Convert” option from the right box to convert your XML Subtitle into SRT format.

![convert xml to srt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-10.jpg)

Now onto converting TTML into SRT format.

## How to Convert TTML to SRT

TTML is a complex caption format that also shows errors with many video players. So it's recommended to convert it into SRT before inserting it in a video.

And for converting TTML to SRT, **BetterConverter** is the right choice.

![ssa subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-2.jpg)

After TTML, it’s time to convert STL subtitles to SRT format.

## How to Convert STL to SRT

Made for broadcasting purposes, STL subtitles are a professional type of subtitles that use some special encodings. So most common video players can't support these files and you need to convert them into SRT files that are more of a universal type.

The online software we’ll be using now is a subtitle converter from Converthelper.

For converting STL subtitles to SRT format, here’s what you need to do.

Step1 Go to the [“STL to SRT Converter”](https://www.converthelper.net/stl-to-srt) from Converthelper.

The last subtitle format we’ll be converting into SRT is the VOB format. Let’s see how to do it.

## How to Convert VOB to SRT

A .vob file extension is a DVD Video Object file that contains video, audio, or even subtitles contents. Most media players can't sort out these types of subtitle files so you must convert them into an SRT file before use.

The best bet for converting a VOB subtitle to SRT is with SONIX.
