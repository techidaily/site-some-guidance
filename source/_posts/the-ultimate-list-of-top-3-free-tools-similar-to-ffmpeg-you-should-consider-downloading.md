FFmpeg vs alternative avconv from Libav, FFmpeg gives more codecs, formats, devices and filters options.

If you receive FFmpeg error message like "This program is only provided for compatibility and will be removed in a future release. Use avconv instead", you are probably using the old version of FFmpeg developed by Libav.
