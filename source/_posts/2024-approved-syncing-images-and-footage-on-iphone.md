## How to shoot a still photo and record a video simultaneously on your iPhone

 The feature of simultaneous photo and video recording had begun since the coming of iPhone 5\. So, iPhone 5 and later model users can enjoy taking photos while recording videos while if we talk about other iOS devices, iPad makes this feature available with its fourth generation as well as iPod touch sixth generation started supporting the feature of capturing stills when recording videos.

 Here are the steps to take photos and videos simultaneously.

* Start with launching camera in your iOS device.
* Look for the video mode and switch to it for initiating video recording.
* Tap the red button located at the bottom and it will start the video recording.

* Now, to take a still, just tap on the white 'take picture' button that can be noticed at the left of the red button. The screen will flicker each time you press the button to take the photo.

### The drawbacks of taking photos and videos simultaneously

*  One of the major drawbacks you can face is being unable to take stills from a time-lapse video in your iPhone.
*  The resolution of the photos taken while recording video will not be the same as the picture captured by the camera of your iPhone. The taken picture's resolution is based on the video's resolution for example; the pictures taken during 4k videos will have more resolution than 1080p. Although they both will lie lower than the standard photo resolution.

 Nevertheless, the resolution loss will increase when taking still from slow motion recording. On one hand where people find standard resolution beyond satisfaction, losing some amount of digits from the resolution won't make difference too for many at the same time.
