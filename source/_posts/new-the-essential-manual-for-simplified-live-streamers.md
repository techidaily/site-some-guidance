## The Essential Manual for Simplified Live Streamers

Live streaming has become the recent trend among content creators as study shows that people engage more in live streams than written posts and regular video uploads. However, pulling off a successful live stream is quite challenging. You will have to get your script correct at the go, there are audio problems, and network issues are not ruled out. Where it all gets messed up is that you can't edit if you make mistakes or an issue can slightly disrupt your stream. So, you have to be extra careful to do it successfully.

Fortunately, with the OneStream live streaming tool, you may not need to worry much because you can successfully and efficiently live stream a pre-recorded video. So, after recording your video and editing it to your taste, you can use OneStream to stream it as a live video to any social platform.

## Part 1\. What is OneStream Live?

[OneStream](https://onestream.live/) Live is a cloud-based live streaming tool that allows you to stream your pre-recorded videos as live videos over any external website. You can simultaneously live stream to over 40 social networks, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, etc. You can also go live (not pre-recorded video) using OneStream.

You also don't have to worry about the requirements of the social platform you are streaming to. OneStream will take care of everything.

## Part 3\. How to live stream with Online OneStream

Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.

Step1 First, head to [OneStream live website](https://app.onestream.live/signup) and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.

Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can't see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.

To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account's Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.

![connect onstream to your social accounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg)

Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the "three-line" button. You will see the schedule button there in the interface. Click it, and a window will appear. You can set the time zone, time, and date you want your stream to go live.

![schedule your live stream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-2.jpg)

Step4 To go live, click on the "new stream" button at the top of your dashboard. You can choose to go live with a recorded video on your device or cloud storage next. Oro select videos from previous video uploads. Click on "Third-party RTMP source" if you want to use OBS, Zoom, etc., to stream via OneStream.

![go live and upload your recorded video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-3.jpg)

## Part 6\. How to Stream with OneStream app on mobile?

Streaming on mobile using OneStream is quite easy, and the steps are not much different from streaming with a desktop.

You may need an external mic because your mobile phone's in-built microphone might not give you your desired audio quality. And extra lighting is indispensable. You can get small light equipment to clip to your mobile device. Make sure you put your mobile phone on a stable surface to avoid shaky videos. You can get a small tripod to serve this purpose.

##### Step2 Just go live with OneStream

Once everything is set, you can open your OneStream app and follow the steps I showed you above in Part 3 (How to live stream with online OneStream).
