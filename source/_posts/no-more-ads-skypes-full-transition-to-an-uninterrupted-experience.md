## No More Ads: Skype's Full Transition to an Uninterrupted Experience

We've come to accept ads as a necessary component of some apps, since they're there to make money on a service that is otherwise free. That doesn't mean they're not often annoying or obnoxious. Skype, for its part, is actually taking the unique step to remove all ads.

 Skype has rolled out a significant update packed with a bunch of user-centric enhancements. The most notable change to be seen here is the removal of all ads across the platform, including all Skype channels. By removing ads completely, Microsoft will certainly make less money on Skype. At the same time, however, Skype already has a credit system for calls and texts, and the company probably already makes most of its money from it. It'll make a bit less money, but given how Skype's popularity keeps dwindling, it's probably negligible. Microsoft already has ads in Windows, Edge, and other core applications that are definitely more profitable (and more annoying for users).

 The AI image creation tool within Skype Desktop has also been revamped. You can now enjoy a streamlined interface, improved image expansion, better navigation, and optimized menu options for a seamless creative experience. Additionally, Skype has introduced OneAuth integration for iPhone and iPad, following its successful implementation on Android. This feature simplifies the sign-in process by automatically logging users into Skype if they are already signed into other Microsoft apps.

 The update also addresses several bugs, including issues with media sending on 5G networks, call pickups on iOS, and notifications on mobile devices. These improvements are being rolled out gradually, so users can expect to see them in their Skype app soon.

 If you want to check out these changes, make sure to keep an eye for the update. It's currently available for Insiders, but should roll out to everyone sooner than later.
