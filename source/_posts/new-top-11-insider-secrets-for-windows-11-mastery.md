The biggest Windows 11 tip and trick is the placement of Taskbar and Start Menu. Windows 11 has a taskbar and start menu in the center.

### 7\. Widgets and Chat Customization

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.
