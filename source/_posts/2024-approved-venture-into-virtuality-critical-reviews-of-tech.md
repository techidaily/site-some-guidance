 Virtual reality treadmills and gloves are changing the life of people to another level. You can now do exercise in virtual reality running on beautiful sites all over the world. Let’s have a look on some of the products.

 A lighter and extra gorgeous option. The stage here is less immense, and phases are pursued by gesture sensors. Squatting actions can be achieved more ordinary due to the option to lean on one knee, deprived of endangering to hurt it. The construction itself is more moveable, which makes it more beautiful, particularly in view of its proportions. Although its official price is unknown yet because mass production of this product has not been started yet.
