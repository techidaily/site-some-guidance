##  Factors to Consider Before Buying a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case

 The primary purpose of using a case with any phone is protection. To get the best protection, you should first consider the materials the case consists of. [Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) is a common material in quality protective cases. It’s flexible, durable, impact—and scratch-resistant, and gives a more ‘grippy’ texture. Other durable materials include polycarbonate (PC), aramid fiber, and leather, the latter offering good defense while looking stylish.

 You’ll also want to consider raised lips around the display and camera lens to ensure the glass doesn’t touch any surface when placed or dropped face down. You’ll also benefit from military-grade drop protection and reinforced corners, although cases like these tend to be on the bulkier, less attractive side.

 However, while thin cases usually offer a lower level of protection, they can still do a good job. They also provide better aesthetics and are less bulky in your hand or pocket. Clear cases are also a go if you prefer the look of your Pixel phone over that of the case. Pixel phones have a unique look, and you might want to avoid covering it up.

 Then, you should consider how you want your stand to function. Do you want it to double as a wallet? Plenty of wallet and folio cases will do a job protecting your phone. Do you [watch movies on your phone](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterful-transitioning-8-leading-convertors-for-sub-and-srt/)? In that case, you might want to check that it has a kickstand for hands-free viewing.

 You may even want to charge your phone without the inconvenience of removing it from the case. In this instance, you should buy a phone that is compatible with your preferred method of charging. Additionally, ensure the case has a built-in magnet if you want to attach it to a magnetic [car mount](https://howto.techidaily.com/7-fixes-for-unfortunately-phone-has-stopped-on-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

 Lastly, make sure your desired phone case is cut for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. The XL is the largest in the [Google Pixel 9 Series](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/1722964871657-install-logitechs-high-performance-g29-driving-force-racing-wheel-on-your-pc-driver-support-for-win7-8-and-10/), so read reviews and make sure the cut is precise and you have full access to all buttons and ports.

##  Best Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Overall: [TORRAS Ostand 360° Spin](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D86Y8SVC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Two TORRAS Ostand 360° Spin cases, one standing vertically, the other horizontally.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/torras-ostand-360-spin.jpg) 

_TORRAS_

| Pros                                                       | Cons           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Compatible with magnetic wallets and power banks           | One color only |
| Excellent kickstand for viewing media or using as a tripod |                |
| Durable materials and military-grade protection            |                |
| Ultra-slim design                                          |                |
| Display and lens protective lips                           |                |

 Our top pick for a Pixel 9 Pro XL case is this versatile choice from TORRAS. The [Ostand 360° Spin](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D86Y8SVC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers superior phone protection and doubles as a flexible kickstand for viewing the display or as a sturdy tripod for taking great photos. The rotatable ring on the back brings versatility to the case, and you can also use it as a secure grip when snapping selfies. When not used, the ring conveniently slots into its groove, adding minimal extra thickness to this ultra-slim protector.

 When you want to use the ring as a kickstand, you pull it out, choose vertical or horizontal positioning depending on your activity, and then fine-tune the angle to get it just right for your line of view. Vertical mode is ideal for snapping portraits, taking video calls, or generally being productive. Horizontal is best for taking sweeping landscapes or street photography snaps, while it’s also ideal for watching media content.

 At just 0.04 inches thick, this case is considered ultra-slim. It’s also lightweight and adds next to no bulk to your Pixel 9 Pro XL. It’s easy to handle with the cushioned silicone ridges on the sides, providing a secure grip, while it also features a special coating that repels oil, water, and fingerprint smudges.

 Attaching the Ostand 360° Spin to car mounts is very reliable, as the magnets are extra strong. This strength ensures your Google Pixel Pro XL remains snapped to your mount, even if you’re winding through country roads or unavoidably hitting bumps and potholes.

 The only way this case hits the deck is if you accidentally drop it. But with 12-foot military-grade protection, even if this does happen, your phone will remain unscathed. With TORRAS X-Shock Air Cushioning, a highly resilient TPU build, and raised lips for your display and camera lens, the Ostand 360° Spin will prove to be the ultimate protector for your phone.

 Foluu is one brand you can turn to if you’re after a high-quality wallet case with a stylish, minimalist design. The [Foluu Flip Folio Wallet Case](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D9QHKJRH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers just that, and its slim, lightweight build ensures it’s also easy to carry around. Additionally, it's surprisingly affordable for such a stylish case.

 The Flip Folio is all about style and convenience, so it doesn’t offer military-grade protection like more rugged cases. However, it does hold its own against scratches, minor bumps, and drops, and its raised lips protect your Pixel 9 Pro XL’s display and camera lens.

 With a PU faux leather canvas and a scratch-resistant TPU lining protecting the interior, the Flip Folio is both attractive and safeguarding. There are compartments for three cards and room for banknotes and coins, meaning you can leave your primary wallet at home and free up some space in your pockets. The magnetic closure completes the design and ensures your cash and cards are safely snug and cozy with your Pixel phone.

 You can also fold the case into kickstand mode, which allows you to make hands-free calls or relax and watch a movie without the inconvenience of holding your phone.

| Pros                                     | Cons                          |

| Stylish and durable                      | MagSafe charging only         |

| Secure grip                              |                               |

 An ultra-thin case is the way to go for anyone seeking minimal bulk from their protective case or if you just prefer the feel of a phone without one. But there’s little point in encasing your Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in a thin cover that offers little protection.

 So, go with the [Thinborne Pixel 9 Pro XL](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D868RRWL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004983&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It features precise button, port, and camera cutouts, measures only 0.04 inches thick, and weighs just 0.8oz. Despite this, the 600D aramid fiber is highly durable, while Thinborne also includes a tempered glass screen protector to add a significant level of protection to your Pixel phone. This should also make its premium price more appealing.

 The lightweight 600D aramid fiber is renowned for its strength. It’s thinner than steel yet 500 percent stronger. Hence, it is used in the aerospace industry, which heavily relies on resilient materials. You should also note that many other aramid-fiber cases use 1500D-grade material. However, the 600D used in this case offers a finer weave that provides better structural strength and a more refined look. Furthermore, the matte carbon fiber finish creates a textured grip to help you hold onto your phone securely.

 An extra protective feature is the raised lips around the camera and display, which ensures they can avoid contact with surfaces when dropped or placed face down. On top of all this, there is the surprising inclusion of a strong magnetic ring for [MagSafe charging](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-read-this-article-to-get-a-fair-and-unbiased-guide-on-top-five-mod-editors-the-article-will-illustrate-the-features-pros-and-cons-of-each-of-the/).

### What is the difference between the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL?

 The main difference is the size. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is the largest in the series. It has dimensions of 6.4 x 3 x 0.33 inches (162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm) and a weight of 7.8oz (221g) compared to the Pixel 9 Pro’s 6 x 2.8 x 0.33 inches (152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm) and 7oz (199g) weight.

 Furthermore, the Pro XL’s display is 6.8 inches in diameter, compared to the Pro’s 6.3\. The Pro XL also features a 5,060mAh battery in comparison to the Pro’s slightly smaller 4,700mAh. This means the Pixel 9 Pro XL should have a better battery life.

 However, you might also want to consider the [differences between the “Pro” models and the standard Google Pixel 9](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-clear-cut-guide-to-high-definition-twitter-videos-for-2024/).

### Can my Google Pixel 9 Pro XL case fit other Google Pixel models?

 No, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is unique in size with regards to other Pixel phones. While there are only slight variations in size with some other models, it’s best to buy a case specifically designed for the Pixel 9 Pro XL for a precise fit. 

### How do I clean my Google Pixel case?

 It all depends on the material it’s made from. For plastic or silicone cases, including those made from TPU, dampen a soft cloth with water, wipe the case using circular motions, and then dry with a clean, dry cloth.

 For fabric cases, you can hand wash with a mild soap and water mix. Once clean, rinse with cold water, then squeeze out the excess and hang it out to dry.

 A leather case requires the removal of dirt and debris with a soft, dry cloth. With another cloth dampened with lukewarm water, gently wipe away any stains. Don’t soak the leather. If the stain persists, you’ll need to use a specialized leather cleaner. Once clean, dry the leather case with the soft, dry cloth.
