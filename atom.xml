It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reddit-marketing-logo.png"                      alt="reddit marketing"                ></p><p>The main reason you should learn how to market on Reddit is because of its vast number of daily and monthly users. Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways"></a>Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-market-on-reddit.png"                      alt="marketing on reddit"                ></p><p><strong>Create Unique Content and Provide Value for Your Audience</strong></p><p>Content is king when it comes to Reddit. To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with <a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

You can use these features in your videos by just clicking on them.</p><h3 id="Filters-and-AI-effects-1"><a href="#Filters-and-AI-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Filters and AI effects"></a>Filters and AI effects</h3><p>We will discuss how we can apply filters and AI effects to our videos using VivaCut. To use them in your videos, first of all, you have to click on the specific video on which you want to use them from the timeline. A menu will appear at the bottom of your mobile’s screen from which you can click on the filters or AI effects option, whatever you want to use. In the free version, you have only access to the limited filters, and AI effects are not available. It would be best to upgrade your plan to get unlimited access to the AI effects and filter library.</p><h3 id="Chroma-Key-1"><a href="#Chroma-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key"></a>Chroma Key</h3><p>Chroma Key is another excellent feature in the VivaCut video editor, which you can use to change your video’s background easily. To use this feature in your videos, you must click on the video layer and select the Chroma key option from the menu at the bottom. You can also set up its settings according to your requirements from the menu. Also, this feature is available in both (free and premium) versions.</p><h3 id="Export-1"><a href="#Export-1" class="headerlink" title="Export"></a>Export</h3><p>Now at the end, we will discuss how we can export our edited videos from it. So we can do this by clicking on the Export button at the top right corner of our screen. In the next step, it will ask us in which quality we want to export our video. Now it’s upon us whether we export it in 720p (HD) or 480p (SD). We can also export our videos in 1080p (FHD), but for this, we have to purchase the premium package of it. Also, as we discussed earlier, we need a premium version to export videos longer than five minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/vivacut-video-editor-review-2.jpg"                      alt="click on export button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-the-VivaCut-Video-Editor-App-1"><a href="#Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-the-VivaCut-Video-Editor-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Even though 8K TV sets have been available on the market since 2012, eight years later, there are still only a handful of models available.</p><p>Despite the stunning image quality, 8K TVs are still too expensive for most consumers. Furthermore, finding the content you can watch on these TV sets is quite difficult, since the technology that is required to record and broadcast 8K footage is expensive. As 2019 draws to a close, it is becoming evident that 8K technology is starting to attract the attention of a growing number of shoppers. That’s why we decided to take you through some of the best 8K TV models on the market.</p><ul><li><a href="#best_8K_tvs">Part 1: Best 8K TVs you can buy in 2024</a></li><li><a href="#what_should_you_consider_when_buying_8K_TV">Part 2: What should you consider when buying an 8K TV?</a></li><li><a href="#is_it_worth_to_buy_8K_tv">Part 3: Is Buying an 8K TV a Good Investment in 2024?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Best-8K-TVs-you-can-buy-in-2024"><a href="#Best-8K-TVs-you-can-buy-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best 8K TVs you can buy in 2024"></a>Best 8K TVs you can buy in 2024</h2><p>There are still many unknowns surrounding the 8K technology, so in this article, we are going to clarify some important factors you need to consider before purchasing an 8K TV for your household. Here’s what some of the best 8K TV sets that you can buy right now.</p><h3 id="1-Sony-85’’-Class-Z9G"><a href="#1-Sony-85’’-Class-Z9G" class="headerlink" title="1. Sony 85’’ Class Z9G"></a>1. Sony 85’’ Class Z9G</h3><p>A brief look at the Z9G’s specification reveals just how impressive this TV set is. In addition to the Picture Processor X1™ that detects moving objects and enhances their details, color, and brightness, this Sony’s model is also equipped with the 8K X-Reality™ Pro upscaling technology.</p><p>The X-Motion Clarity™ ensures that rapidly moving objects are always crispy sharp and in focus, while the powerful 8K X-tended Dynamic Range™ perfectly balances the contrast between the brightest and the darkest area of the screen.</p><p>The size of this 8K TVs guarantees that all details are going to be perfectly clear on the display. That is the reason why Z9G is available in two sizes, so you can choose between 85-inch and 98-inch diagonal models.</p><p>Despite an impressive list of features, the price you will have to pay for Sony 85’’ Class Z9G 8K TV is still steep, as this model currently costs $13,000.</p><h3 id="2-LG-Signature-Z9-88-inch-Class-8K-Smart-OLED-TV"><a href="#2-LG-Signature-Z9-88-inch-Class-8K-Smart-OLED-TV" class="headerlink" title="2. LG Signature Z9 88-inch Class 8K Smart OLED TV"></a>2. LG Signature Z9 88-inch Class 8K Smart OLED TV</h3><p>The world’s first OLED 8K Smart TV brings the quality of the picture that is four times higher than the image quality you can expect from 4K TV sets.</p><p>The 8K UHD display is equipped with a Cinema HDR as well as the α9 Gen 2 Intelligent Processor 8K picture processor provides the ultra-realistic image. The Hexa Step Noise Reduction and Frequency Based Sharpness Enhancer deliver a stunning level of image clarity and make the LG’s 8K Smart TV perfectly suited for gaming and home theater experiences.</p><p>The LG Signature Z9 model features an LG ThinQ® AI, as well as intelligent voice recognition, Google Assistant and Alexa. This 8K OLED Smart TV runs on the WebOS, enables you to browse the Internet effortlessly and it offers point, click, scroll and voice remote control options.</p><p>The sound system that comes with this high-end television set is as impressive as all of its other features, but the hefty price tag and limited warranty make LG Signature Z9 88-inch Class 8K Smart OLED TV available only to a small circle of TV enthusiast.</p><h3 id="3-Samsung-75’’-Class-Q900"><a href="#3-Samsung-75’’-Class-Q900" class="headerlink" title="3. Samsung 75’’ Class Q900"></a>3. Samsung 75’’ Class Q900</h3><p>This Samsung’s Smart TV is less expensive than the previous two models we featured in this article. The Q900’s Quantum Processor 8K is less powerful than those you can find on pricier 8K UHD TVs, while its Quantum HDR 32X isn’t as wide as you could expect from a high-end television set such as this Samsung’s 8K model.</p><p>Even so, the Dynamic Black Equalizer and the FreeSync™ technology make Samsung Q900 a perfect choice for all gamers. Moreover, the ultra-viewing angle panel guarantees that colors are equally vibrant regardless of the angle from which you view them.</p><p>Samsung’s 8K QLED TV set features the Intelligent Mode that automatically matches the image brightness and the sound level to the room conditions. The 8K AI upscaling feature enhances 4K or HD visual content and maximizes its quality.

In addition, QLED can detect room colors and utilize them to generate patterns that can make any room more stylish.</p><h3 id="4-Sharp-Aquos-8K-TV"><a href="#4-Sharp-Aquos-8K-TV" class="headerlink" title="4. Sharp Aquos 8K TV"></a>4. Sharp Aquos 8K TV</h3><p>The 8K television sets from the Aquos series are available in three different sizes, so you can choose from 60’’, 70’’ and 80’’ models.

Each of the Aquos 8K TV models features a powerful sound system that reproduces all sounds accurately and without any quality loss.</p><h3 id="The-Comparison-of-the-Best-8K-TVs-in-2024"><a href="#The-Comparison-of-the-Best-8K-TVs-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="The Comparison of the Best 8K TVs in 2024"></a>The Comparison of the Best 8K TVs in 2024</h3><table><thead><tr><th><strong>8K TV Model</strong></th><th><strong>Sony Z9G</strong></th><th><strong>LG Signature Z9</strong></th><th><strong>Samsung 75’’ Class Q900</strong></th><th><strong>Sharp Aquos 8K TV</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td>$12,999,99</td><td>$29,999,99</td><td>$6,999,99</td><td>Depends on the model</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Screen size</strong></td><td>85-inch</td><td>88-inch</td><td>75-inch</td><td>60, 70 and 80-inch</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Panel type</strong></td><td>LCD</td><td>OLED</td><td>QLED</td><td>LED</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HDR Compatibility</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Refresh rate</strong></td><td>240 Hz</td><td>Variable refresh rate</td><td>240 Hz</td><td>100&#x2F;120 Hz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voice control</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="What-should-you-consider-when-buying-an-8K-TV"><a href="#What-should-you-consider-when-buying-an-8K-TV" class="headerlink" title="What should you consider when buying an 8K TV?"></a>What should you consider when buying an 8K TV?</h3><p>Although 8K TVs have been on the market for the larger part of this decade, they are still far from being largely accepted by the mainstream. However, there is no doubt that the quality of the images and sound 8K TV sets can reproduce surpasses that of most powerful Full HD and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The <strong>size of the TV’s display</strong> is the first and probably the most crucial factor you should consider before you choose to purchase an 8K TV. The difference in the picture quality between 4K and 8K television sets isn’t that obvious if the diagonal of the display is relatively short. The vast majority of the 8K TV models have <strong>diagonals that range from 60 to 100 inches.</strong> The quality of the details becomes more visible as the size of the TV increases, which is why you shouldn’t choose 8K TV models that have diagonals that are shorter than 80 inches.</p><p>Besides the size, you should also pay close attention to the TV’s <strong>image processing capabilities</strong>, its <strong>dynamic range,</strong> and the <strong>upscaling options.</strong> The dynamic range guarantees that the contrast between the darkest and brightest areas of the screen is going to be perfectly balanced, which enables you to see objects that are in the shadows clearly.</p><p>Moreover, the accuracy with which the 8K TV depicts colors depends on its image processing capacity, so you must make sure that the model you are considering can display realistic colors even when playing demanding visual content.</p><p>The 8K upscaling options are particularly important because finding the videos or video games in 8K resolution is still difficult, and TV’s upscaling potential can bring out the most of the visual content in lower resolutions.</p><h3 id="Is-Buying-an-8K-TV-a-Good-Investment-in-2024"><a href="#Is-Buying-an-8K-TV-a-Good-Investment-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Is Buying an 8K TV a Good Investment in 2024?"></a>Is Buying an 8K TV a Good Investment in 2024?</h3><p>Despite being commercially available, 8K TVs are still excruciatingly expensive. Their price is hardly justified because the content in 8K resolution isn’t easy to come by. Currently, only a handful of professional video cameras offer the option to capture footage in this resolution, and most TV and movie productions have been slow in adopting the 8K resolution.</p><p>Professional cinematographers and video editors who need to process the footage captured in 8K resolution can benefit from purchasing an 8K TV set or monitor because it will enable them to see how the material they are editing is going to look like.</p><p>However, it is too early for most homeowners to jump on the 8K train because it still isn’t clear if the movie and TV stations are going to make the switch to the 8K resolution in the near future. Until the 8K resolution becomes the industry standard, it is better to stick to 4K television sets simply because there is more content available.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The hyper-realistic images 8K TVs can reproduce would leave anyone breathless, as the level of detail they depict is unprecedented. Nonetheless, the 8K technology is still developing, and at this point, it is hard to say if it will become the industry standard in the foreseeable future. The selection of 8K TV models is going to remain as scarce in 2024 as it was in the previous years, so it may be a good idea to postpone buying of a new 8K TV until more models become available on the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-strategies-for-eye-catching-podcast-previews/"><u>[New] Strategies for Eye-Catching Podcast Previews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-design-and-build-your-own-4k-editing-system-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Design and Build Your Own 4K Editing System for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-top-15-masterpieces-in-stop-motion-cinema-history/"><u>[Updated] Top 15 Masterpieces in Stop-Motion Cinema History</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-striking-the-right-chord-in-your-podcast-summary/"><u>2024 Approved  Striking the Right Chord in Your Podcast Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-handbook-for-hosting-zoom-events-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Handbook for Hosting Zoom Events on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-the-mysteries-of-firefoxs-pip-mode/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling the Mysteries of Firefox’s PIP Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-top-9-tools-for-making-gifs-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide  Top 9 Tools for Making GIFs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-symphony-of-sights-picture-plus-sound-videography/"><u>2024 Approved  Symphony of Sights  Picture + Sound Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/top-10-streaming-services-a-must-know-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 Streaming Services - A Must Know for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-comprehensive-guide-to-acquiring-instagram-ringtones-and-creating-noteworthy-chimes-for-2024/"><u>The Comprehensive Guide to Acquiring Instagram Ringtones & Creating Noteworthy Chimes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/maximize-visibility-and-views-on-youtube/"><u>Maximize Visibility and Views on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-x-recorder-plus-professional-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  X-Recorder Plus - Professional Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/monetary-aspects-of-shopping-reviews-vlogs/"><u>Monetary Aspects of Shopping Reviews Vlogs?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-set-a-unique-tiktok-sound-as-your-cellphone-alarm-or-ringtone/"><u>2024 Approved  Set a Unique TikTok Sound as Your Cellphone Alarm or Ringtone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/read-this-guide-to-find-a-reliable-alternative-to-fake-gps-on-nokia-xr21-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Read This Guide to Find a Reliable Alternative to Fake GPS On Nokia XR21 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/the-recommended-natural-ai-hindi-voice-generator-for-2024/"><u>The Recommended Natural AI Hindi Voice Generator for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-nuances-of-cross-system-skype-group-communication-effectively-and-efficiently/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Nuances of Cross-System Skype Group Communication Effectively and Efficiently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/experts-choice-the-best-windows-pc-screen-recorders-for-2024/"><u>Expert's Choice  The Best Windows PC Screen Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-streamlining-your-itunes-video-recordings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Streamlining Your iTunes Video Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-harnessing-spotifys-melodies-practical-steps-for-digitally-capturing-playlists-and-songs/"><u>New Harnessing Spotifys Melodies Practical Steps for Digitally Capturing Playlists and Songs</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?"></a>Part 2. How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?</h2><p>The best way to present any news related to any sports event is to create a short video containing all the highlights of the event. For example, you can create a video combining all the highlights of short track speed skating 2022 that we have presented in the previous section. You can also collect short clips of the event from social media platforms that have been captured by audiences.</p><p>To create such a highlight video on any sports event, there are certain videos effects commonly used that you should know about.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong> – Since you are going to use a lot of still photos, the transition from one photo to another should be smooth. This is where transition effects come into the play so that the viewer does not feel any jarring effect and sudden changes as they move from one slide in your video to another.</p><p><strong>Slow Motion</strong> – If you have collected from short clips of the event, you can use slow motion effect to prolong the clip and give enough time for your viewer to watch it. Slow motion effect is quite captivating and intriguing in today’s videography world.</p><p><strong>Motion Tracking</strong> – Using motion tracking, you can track the movement of a particular object or athlete in a video. This helps to attach certain elements such as clipart, text, icon to that particular athlete throughout the video for easy identification by the viewers.</p><p><strong>Pan and Zoom</strong> – Pan and Zoom is the most commonly used video effect that is applied to still footage. While the footage zooms out, texts and titles are shown or a voiceover is played so that the graphic on the screen does not stay static.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>To create a video based on any sport event such as short track speed skating highlights, you need a professional video editor where you can get all the video effects and elements in one place.

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB). What is the maximum video length that can be uploaded on Facebook? 25md is equal to how many seconds of video.</p><p>- 1 minute, 25-megabyte video.

I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files.

The HoloLens came in an eye catching black box. The HoloLens comes in an interesting case with a zipper and once you unzip it, you come across a beautifully crafted head gear comprising of two rings with a lens.</p><p> Apart from the HoloLens, the box contains few accessories namely a get started guide, a charger with USB cable, a nose piece and a form fitting strap. Besides, there is also the new HoloLens Clicker, an optional accessory that comes with a finger loop.</p><h2 id="Main-features-of-Microsoft-HoloLens"><a href="#Main-features-of-Microsoft-HoloLens" class="headerlink" title="Main features of Microsoft HoloLens"></a>Main features of Microsoft HoloLens</h2><p> HoloLens consists of two rings- an outer thicker plastic ring that contains the guts and an inner, thinner ring that wraps around your head. This device isn’t essentially designed to sit on the user’s nose but there is a rubber nose guard that is optional to use. The headgear weighs approximately 579gms which means this one is definitely not a lighter device.</p><p> The headset contains holographic lenses and a depth camera along with speakers above the ears. There is literally a host of sensors built into the headset that include an ambient light sensor along with not just one or two but four environment sensing cameras that work in complete sync with depth sensing camera.</p><p> There is an onboard processing via Intel 32 bit architecture, a GPU, HPU that are backed by 2GB RAM and a humongous 64 GB onboard storage. The resolution of device is unbelievable in terms of picture and video quality and even the audio of HoloLens is admirable and the one that is bound to give every gamer a sensational gaming experience.</p><p> The release date for Microsoft’s HoloLens hasn’t been announced as yet but this device is available for developers and the people having a Microsoft account. The developer’s device is priced at $3000 but we are contemplating that it will be priced slightly on the lower side for the usual customers. A Microsoft account holder can order as many as 5 HoloLens from one account and if market trends are to be believed, the customer edition will be released around Christmas this year itself.</p><h2 id="User-experience"><a href="#User-experience" class="headerlink" title="User experience"></a>User experience</h2><p> Using Microsoft HoloLens was surely an experience of a lifetime, the one that you can’t easily forget. This wonderful device is filled with a number of pros, however we did come across a few cons as well, all of which are enlisted below for your quick reference.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Hands free hologram experience</li></ul><p> Using HoloLens is no rocket science, Microsoft has taken a number of steps to make this device extremely user friendly. There are no wires and remote control that works over this device, all you get is a head gear that has a few inbuilt buttons on the outer rin</p><ul><li>Impressive resolution</li></ul><p> Microsoft’s promise to give its users an ultimate holographic experience with HoloLens doesn’t seem illogical. The resolution of this device is so impressive that it literally transforms you to another world of digital excellence.</p><ul><li>Spatial sound like never before</li></ul><p> Apart from the high quality holographic resolution, HoloLens even boasts upon excellent spatial sound system that works wonders in giving its users a worthy AR experience.</p><ul><li>Excellent build quality</li></ul><p> Microsoft’s HoloLens comes with a headgear that might appear like few of its contemporaries, however the build quality that it comes with makes it all the more likeable and better device.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-LG’s-Advanced-4K-Visual-Display"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-LG’s-Advanced-4K-Visual-Display" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to LG’s Advanced 4K Visual Display"></a>The Ultimate Guide to LG’s Advanced 4K Visual Display</h2><h1 id="LG-UltraFine-4K-Monitor-Complete-Review"><a href="#LG-UltraFine-4K-Monitor-Complete-Review" class="headerlink" title="LG UltraFine 4K Monitor Complete Review"></a>LG UltraFine 4K Monitor Complete Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> You will see very few successful partnerships in the market but there is something unique about LG and Apple. They together have designed incredible 4K displays that are budget friendly and feature rich too. LG UltraFine 4K monitor is just a fantastic choice for beginners as well as professionals. Here are few incredible details about this UltraFine 4K monitor that will help you to make easy decision about investment.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> This monitor appears somewhat like UltraFine 5K but with smaller form factor. It has attractive round edges and you will not find bezels with its little face. It displays everything in non-distracting manner. The overall screen size is 21.5 inches and this monitor works like a multi-tasker unit. It is well known as professional grade video and photo editor that can be easily rotated to any possible direction as per need. UltraFine 4K has wide elevation range and its elevation mount is highly sturdy with telescopic design. You can easily handle this stand and it is possible to attach this monitor to standard VESA mount having special VESA cover. You will not find any button on its frame, not even the power button so it appears very clean. Everything can be handled with automatic tweak settings and it is also possible to manage most of the things via Mac OS also. Behind the screen, there are stereo speakers that ensure incredible performance.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.Ports and Connectivity"></a>2.Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="Lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> You must be curious to know about the connectivity options available with this fine line monitor. There are two options: Thunderbolt 3 ports and USB type port. You can access its USB-C port to manage power, audio and data transfers even with single cable. That means you can charge your MacBook directly from this monitor. Note that, the USB-C port cannot work same as ThunderBolt 3 that allows users to enjoy much higher transfer speeds but this port stays restricted to MacBook Pro. You will not be able to find DisplayPort and HDMI connection options on this monitor but it just enhances design and saves more space.</p><p> Here, you will be transmitting data and videos on USB-C port instead of using ThunderBolt 3. This type of connectivity limits the expected capabilities of this monitor as one can enjoy lesser bandwidth where USB-C port follows speed range of USB 2.0 port.</p><h4 id="3-Image-Quality"><a href="#3-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Image Quality"></a>3.Image Quality</h4><p> If we call this display same as that of Apple products then the indication is directly towards its quality. Right from the moment when you turn this monitor ON for the very first time, it appears brilliant, vibrant and bright with impressively managed colours on every portion of the screen. Those who are using the retina type displays of MacBooks from several years will find this screen perfect for their needs as they need not to compromise for low resolution. This UltraFine display monitor can handle P3 color gamut that leads to incredible results for videos as well as images. It means you will find this monitor perfectly suitable to access your mobile photography with deep details. This LG monitor has matte black look on borders and that give ultimate impression. The glossy screen makes stunning color popup but this screen is not much suitable for bright locations. This 21.5” monitor can handle 4,096x2,304 resolution level with crisp details. You can access the scaling feature of MacBook to improve its text size up to readable level.</p><h4 id="4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager"><a href="#4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager" class="headerlink" title="4.Multi Function Screen Manager"></a>4.Multi Function Screen Manager</h4><p> Here is one important thing to note about LG UltraFine 4K monitor; manufacturers have designed it to work perfectly with MacOS with multi function screen manager option. That means, users can easily divide their monitor screen into 2 to 4 frames so that multiple things can be accessed at a time without facing any complexity in handling. All the screens get well arranged on this monitor and the displays appear perfectly fine.</p><h2 id="Compatible-with-Windows"><a href="#Compatible-with-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Compatible with Windows?"></a>Compatible with Windows?</h2><p> Now, this must be the most important question in every reader’s mind. Those who have PCs at their home must be thinking to find better connectivity options on windows. So the great news is that there is no technical issue related to such connection. But we have few reasons that limit your usage on windows.</p><p> You will find several monitors that are designed with classic colour profiles. Note that, if these monitors do not find a computer that can handle extended gamut then they keep on reflecting back the details to sRGB mechanism. This is a big trouble. But when you connect such high end monitors with MacOS then you will be able to handle everything via specially designed software AppKit. It helps to make perfect negotiation with the monitor color information and everything on screen appears good. Thus, it is better to use this monitor with MacOS only.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> If you already own the 12” MacBook of Apple then this LG Ultrafine display unit is best choice for you. Some of you may find its 21.5” screen size little smaller but it suits perfectly to the Apple’s notebook collections. Professionals can easily handle all movements with touch bar on their device and its ability to handle multiple screens at a time makes it more suitable for high end users. The aesthetic performance of LG UltraFine 4K device is definitely awesome; you need not to make any compromise for video clarity, quality and performance on this device. The overall score as per reviewers rating is 4 out of 5 for this stunning 4K monitor. It is good to place your order fast to receive this well designed monitor soon at your door step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transforming-visuals-the-power-of-customized-luts/"><u>2024 Approved  Transforming Visuals  The Power of Customized LUTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tranquil-twilight-tales-in-video-form/"><u>2024 Approved  Tranquil Twilight Tales in Video Form</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/unveiling-inshot-a-thorough-editor-investigation-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling InShot  A Thorough Editor Investigation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/uniting-zoom-and-skype-techniques-to-maximize-video-call-quality-for-2024/"><u>Uniting Zoom and Skype  Techniques to Maximize Video Call Quality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/unveiling-nikons-1j5-a-4k-video-masterpiece-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling Nikon's 1J5  A 4K Video Masterpiece for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-editors-treasure-trove-curated-list-of-iconic-80s-vhs-hacks-for-editing/"><u>In 2024, The Editor's Treasure Trove  Curated List of Iconic 80S VHS Hacks for Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-uncover-the-best-10-online-vectors-collections/"><u>In 2024, Uncover the Best 10 Online Vectors Collections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tactics-for-triumphing-in-virtual-marketplaces/"><u>2024 Approved  Tactics for Triumphing in Virtual Marketplaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-updated-list-top-frame-addition-services-for-images/"><u>[Updated] Updated List  Top Frame Addition Services for Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-full-photo-viewing-capabilities-win-11-edition/"><u>[New] Unlocking Full Photo Viewing Capabilities  Win 11 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-top-10-best-photo-watermarking-software-you-should-try/"><u>[New] Top 10 Best Photo Watermarking Software You Should Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-video-editors-rising-from-vimeos-shadow/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Video Editors Rising From Vimeo's Shadow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capture-and-conquer-mastering-visual-storytelling/"><u>2024 Approved  Capture and Conquer  Mastering Visual Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-apples-m1-milestone-the-next-gen-computing-core/"><u>[New] Apple’s M1 Milestone  The Next-Gen Computing Core</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/trapped-in-online-purgatory-discover-why/"><u>Trapped in Online Purgatory?

Weight of your drone"></a>1. Weight of your drone</h4><p>The very first criterion for selection of right motor for your drone is to have clear idea about overall weight of drone itself.</p><p>You can have approximate weight idea for your drone by simply calculating weight of its individual parts or components. But note that the list must include all parts like payload (if you are connecting gimbals and camera), battery unit, motors, wires, PDB, flight controller and frame of the device.</p><p>Once you know the overall size of frame then it can help you to determine right propeller size. Whereas the idea about size and weight of propeller will help users to know about the overall thrust of motor that they will need for perfect lifting of drone during flights. Your decision will help to maintain speed of drone in air and this weight will also contribute in flight time adjustments.</p><h4 id="2-Thrust-to-weight-ratio"><a href="#2-Thrust-to-weight-ratio" class="headerlink" title="2. Thrust to weight ratio"></a>2. Thrust to weight ratio</h4><p>Do you know the golden rule for selection of drone motor? It must allow your drone to hover in the midair with half throttle. It clearly means that your selected motor must be capable enough to produce about 50 percent higher thrust as compared to multi rotor.</p><p>This is a very essential parameter as it means your motor is going to have additional thrust to keep your drone safe during windy weather or at the time of flight maneuvers.</p><p>Let us consider a situation: suppose your drone have overall weight of 650 grams then we need to pick a motor that can generate at least twice amount of thrust. Means thrust must range somewhere around 1360 Grams where each motor must be capable enough to produce 340 grams thrust.</p><p>And in case if they are able to produce higher thrust then this rated value, your drone will naturally become able to move with much faster speed.</p><h4 id="3-Efficiency"><a href="#3-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="3. Efficiency"></a>3. Efficiency</h4><p>The formula used for calculation of motor efficiency is “thrust&#x2F;power used in W”; its overall unit becomes g&#x2F;W. now, if you have higher value of g&#x2F;W rating that means your motor is more efficient and it will assist drone in longer flights.</p><p>Professionals recommend choosing a motor that has efficiency value near about 7 or above this. There are chances that a motor could be efficient with its lower throttle range; in that case they will lose efficiency with increasing current range at higher limits.</p><p>When you connect motors having low efficiency to your drone unit then you have to make lots of compromise for flight time as well as energy. It will also cause voltage sags for your batteries. Never forget to check thrust&#x2F;current ratio while buying new motor for your drone.</p><h4 id="4-Torque"><a href="#4-Torque" class="headerlink" title="4. Torque"></a>4. Torque</h4><p>The torque range helps to define the ability of motor to shift between RPM values. This change ultimately decides responsiveness of drone in air. If your motor has high torque value then it will naturally lead to snappy response as RPM will accept faster changes. It will also lead to lesser propeller wash.</p><p>If you have high torque value for your motor then it means it is capable enough to run much heavier props but will also suck more current. In case if you try to fir a heavier propeller on low torque type motor, it will not be able to achieve the desired RPM value or will not be able to generate enough torque for spinning.</p><p>Ultimately, it will end up making lower thrust while drawing lower current from system. However, there is one disadvantage of connection high torque type motors; that is, it generates more oscillations and they cannot be tuned so easily.</p><p>Note that, high torque type motors are able to generate faster response rate so users can move between different RPM rating easily and efficiently. It may also amplify error and can cause oscillations even at yaw axis.</p><h4 id="5-Pole-Count"><a href="#5-Pole-Count" class="headerlink" title="5. Pole Count"></a>5. Pole Count</h4><p>Next important consideration is motor pole count. You will generally find two options for this: first one if quadcopter motors that have higher pole count. These types of motors are able to produce greater torque value but at the same time it will demand more voltage for operation.</p><p>Note that these motors are able to produce lower RPM. Professionals suggest choosing larger blades for such motors.</p><p>If we talk about the second category, here you will find motors having lower pole count but they deliver higher RPM. Now, these motors will be accompanied by smaller blades and will serve with smaller lift from ground.</p><p>If you want to get rid of additional gear box then it is essential to start with higher pole count.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-motors"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-motors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Types of motors"></a>Part 2: Types of motors</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Definition</th><th>Application</th><th>Lifespan</th><th>Energy saving</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brushed DC motor</td><td>Brushed DC motors possess a rotating armature that works like a electromagnet having two poles. A rotary switch is connected that helps to reverse current direction for every half cycle so that poles can be pushed or pulled against permanent magnets connected outside motor.</td><td>It is commonly used as a power tool for drones.</td><td>It can serve users up to 1000 hours or less.</td><td>In case of Brushed motor designs, you need to invest upon continuous maintenance for carbon crushes to ensure proper energy consumption and satisfactory operation.</td></tr><tr><td>Brushless DC motor</td><td>Brushless DC Motors do not possess brushes, they just have a permanent magnet and it switched with electronic polarity changes. Its movements can be controlled via a dedicated electronic controller and speed feedback mechanism.</td><td>These motors are commonly used for drones that demand higher rotation speeds to manage flights.</td><td>Brushed DC motors are capable enough to work effectively up to more than 1000 hours</td><td>Brusheless motors are highly energy efficient as compared to brushed ones.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p><p>If you are working on a project where motor is expected to be used for very less time, it is recommended to connect brushed DC motor as it will provide sufficient output with cost effectiveness. But in case if you need motors continuously or when your device is going to work on higher power rating then brushless motor will be best idea for long hour flights.</p><h2 id="5-Best-Recommendation-for-Drone-Motors"><a href="#5-Best-Recommendation-for-Drone-Motors" class="headerlink" title="5 Best Recommendation for Drone Motors"></a>5 Best Recommendation for Drone Motors</h2><h4 id="1-Coolplay-syma-x5c-1-x5c-x5-motors"><a href="#1-Coolplay-syma-x5c-1-x5c-x5-motors" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is impossible to anticipate your future storage requirements. As technology continues to improve, data file sizes will only increase. Therefore, you require cloud storage that allows you to save an unlimited number of data. However, finding unlimited cloud storage is not easy. Fortunately, this article will recommend some <strong>unlimited cloud storage</strong> services based on your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage.png"                      alt="cloud storage introduction pic"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">OpenDrive</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Icedrive</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Google Workspace</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Dropbox</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Box</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Flickr Pro</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-Top-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-individual-users"><a href="#Part1-Top-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-individual-users" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Top Best price of unlimited cloud storage for individual users"></a>Part1: Top Best price of unlimited cloud storage for individual users</h2><h3 id="1-OpenDrive"><a href="#1-OpenDrive" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenDrive"></a>1. OpenDrive</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/opendrive-1.jpg"                      alt="opendrive illustration"                ></p><p>If you need <strong>unlimited cloud storage</strong> with many features, then you could rely on OpenDrive. Indeed, OpenDrive is versatile cloud storage for personal use. It offers <strong>unlimited cloud</strong>, mirror-image backups, and web, desktop, or mobile app access. It also has useful features such as Zoho Docs, which enables the creation of documents and other file kinds within the app. Additionally, you will be amazed by its retention term, which is three times longer than competing services.</p><p>Furthermore, the price is one of the best things regarding OpenDrive. At only $9.95 per user each month, the Personal Unlimited plan is pretty cheap. Also, it doesn’t have a minimum number of users. Hence, it is good if you don’t have anyone to split the bill with.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zero-knowledge encryption is one of the most popular security features for online storage, and OpenDrive has it., OpenDrive will create a folder called “secure files.” The AES 256-bit encryption protects all the files you put in this folder. You can also create sync and backup tasks in this folder.</p><h3 id="2-Icedrive"><a href="#2-Icedrive" class="headerlink" title="2. Icedrive"></a>2. Icedrive</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/icedrive-1.jpg"                      alt="icedrive illustration"                ></p><p>Icedrive just started up in 2019, making it the youngest cloud storage on this list. Nevertheless, it has quickly become one of the best services out there because it started out with zero-knowledge encryption and low prices.</p><p>If you use Windows, you can use Explorer to look through your storage space and do things like move, rename, open, and even edit files, just like you would on a local drive. Meanwhile, a custom app for Windows, Mac, and Linux goes even further, letting you browse files, preview documents, and stream your media files with a built-in player without having to download it</p><p>The price of Icedrive is probably the best thing about it. If 1TB of storage feels like enough space to you, then $4.17 per month for the annual basis is probably the best deal you can find. Icedrive also has subscriptions for a lifetime for $13.86, which can be a good choice if you plan to use your storage for a long time.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-business-users"><a href="#Part-2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-business-users" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users"></a>Part 2: Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users</h2><h3 id="1-Google-Workspace"><a href="#1-Google-Workspace" class="headerlink" title="1.

When you use Google Workspace, you get Google Drive and all the tools that are part of Google workspace, such as Gmail, Meet, Keep, Calendar, Chat and the full suite of office software. You should consider if your company already relies on Google’s products or if you need a suite of tools that don’t require high-end hardware.</p><p>There are many business features in Google Drive and the rest of Workspace. There are a lot of tools for working together and managing things, like desktop apps for Windows and macOS, real-time syncing, encryption, file versioning, and scanning documents. Meanwhile, there is two-factor authentication, group-based policy controls, and encryption are used to keep things safe, with encryption getting better in enterprise plans.</p><p>There are four different plans for Google Workspace that you can use for your business. Unfortunately, Google Workspace is not offered <strong>free unlimited cloud storage.</strong> The first plan (Business Starter) costs $4.20 &#x2F;user&#x2F;month, which gives you 30 GB of storage per user. Next, another Google Workspace plan (Business Standard) costs $9.60 &#x2F;per user&#x2F;month and gives you 2 TB of storage per user. Thirdly, business Plus costs $18 &#x2F;user&#x2F;month and gives you 5 TB of storage for each user. Lastly, the Enterprise plan which gives you unlimited storage.

Dropbox</h3><p>Dropbox’s Business Advanced Plan is excellent if you need unlimited cloud storage. The Business Advanced Plan is the Dropbox plan with a price that includes unlimited storage capacity. Unfortunately, Dropbox Advanced Plan is not a <strong>free unlimited cloud storage</strong>. The Advanced Plan for Businesses costs $24 per user each month. With a minimum of three people necessary to join up, the actual monthly cost is $72. If you prefer to be billed annually, you can save 20%.</p><p>The speed of Dropbox is among its most remarkable features. It uploads massive volumes of data at a fraction of the time of its competitors, so you will never lose time waiting for file uploads. In terms of security, Dropbox has gotten a lot better over time. It has 256-bit AES encryption at rest, 128-bit AES encryption in transit, and two-factor authentication, and you can even wipe your device remotely if it gets stolen. You can also choose to host your data in a European data centre.</p><h3 id="3-Box"><a href="#3-Box" class="headerlink" title="3. Box"></a>3. Box</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/box.jpg"                      alt="box"                ></p><p>Box says that 70% of the 500 companies with the fastest growth use their storage service. One of its most important reasons is that it gives you unlimited cloud storage. As a result, you can interact with team members and provide file access from any device and location. In addition, the platform provides various unrestricted business options with no limit on the number of files that may be uploaded to a cloud server.</p><p>Meanwhile, Box can also work with over 1500 other apps, such as Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and Office 365, all popular office productivity and collaboration tools. These apps also make it easy to open, change, and save files.</p><p>Regarding security systems, a zero-trust architecture approach ensures that teams can work together safely by using strong user authentication with SSO and MFA support, device security, and information rights management with vector-based watermarking. You also get seven user-friendly permission roles, device trust, and application controls. The Box is FIPS 140-2 certified; even better, every file is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption at rest and in transit.</p><p>Just like a Dropbox Advanced Plan, Box unlimited storage service is not an unlimited free storage.

Given that most of us take pictures daily, this doesn’t seem like a very generous offer. If you want unlimited storage, you’ll need to upgrade to Flickr Pro, which costs money. Therefore, you can subscribe monthly for $8.49 or annually for $80.04. If you join the annual plan, you gain access to amazing bonuses, such as two free months of Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.</p><p>Flickr Pro includes limitless storage space and is compatible with iOS, Android, and PC web browsers. In addition, Flickr permits the upload of JPEG, PNG, and non-animated GIF files but not RAW images, which may be disappointing to professional photographers.</p><p>If this limitation does not bother you, Flickr’s additional features compensate for it. One of its coolest features is the AutoUploader uploading tool, which allows you to upload a collection of photos from multiple sources. Moreover, Flickr, like many commercial websites, uses SSL&#x2F;TLS, the small green lock next to a browser’s URL address bar, to create a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher AES encryption, making sure that communication between your devices and Flickr is safe.</p><h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Question"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Question" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Question"></a>Frequently Asked Question</h2><h3 id="Is-Cloud-Storage-Safe"><a href="#Is-Cloud-Storage-Safe" class="headerlink" title="Is Cloud Storage Safe?"></a>Is Cloud Storage Safe?</h3><p>Most cloud storage providers encrypt your data before it is delivered to their servers, and many also keep your data in an encrypted format. Nevertheless, no system is entirely safe, and cloud storage servers can be compromised. As a prevention, you can set two-factor authentication with cloud storage services.

Indeed, OpenDrive is versatile cloud storage for personal use. It offers <strong>unlimited cloud</strong>, mirror-image backups, and web, desktop, or mobile app access. It also has useful features such as Zoho Docs, which enables the creation of documents and other file kinds within the app. Additionally, you will be amazed by its retention term, which is three times longer than competing services.</p><p>Furthermore, the price is one of the best things regarding OpenDrive. At only $9.95 per user each month, the Personal Unlimited plan is pretty cheap. Also, it doesn’t have a minimum number of users. Hence, it is good if you don’t have anyone to split the bill with.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zero-knowledge encryption is one of the most popular security features for online storage, and OpenDrive has it., OpenDrive will create a folder called “secure files.” The AES 256-bit encryption protects all the files you put in this folder. You can also create sync and backup tasks in this folder.</p><h3 id="2-Icedrive-1"><a href="#2-Icedrive-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Icedrive"></a>2.

Nevertheless, it has quickly become one of the best services out there because it started out with zero-knowledge encryption and low prices.</p><p>If you use Windows, you can use Explorer to look through your storage space and do things like move, rename, open, and even edit files, just like you would on a local drive. Meanwhile, a custom app for Windows, Mac, and Linux goes even further, letting you browse files, preview documents, and stream your media files with a built-in player without having to download it</p><p>The price of Icedrive is probably the best thing about it. If 1TB of storage feels like enough space to you, then $4.17 per month for the annual basis is probably the best deal you can find. Icedrive also has subscriptions for a lifetime for $13.86, which can be a good choice if you plan to use your storage for a long time.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-business-users-1"><a href="#Part-2-Best-price-of-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-business-users-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users"></a>Part 2: Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users</h2><h3 id="1-Google-Workspace-1"><a href="#1-Google-Workspace-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

When you use Google Workspace, you get Google Drive and all the tools that are part of Google workspace, such as Gmail, Meet, Keep, Calendar, Chat and the full suite of office software. You should consider if your company already relies on Google’s products or if you need a suite of tools that don’t require high-end hardware.</p><p>There are many business features in Google Drive and the rest of Workspace. There are a lot of tools for working together and managing things, like desktop apps for Windows and macOS, real-time syncing, encryption, file versioning, and scanning documents. Meanwhile, there is two-factor authentication, group-based policy controls, and encryption are used to keep things safe, with encryption getting better in enterprise plans.</p><p>There are four different plans for Google Workspace that you can use for your business.

It uploads massive volumes of data at a fraction of the time of its competitors, so you will never lose time waiting for file uploads. In terms of security, Dropbox has gotten a lot better over time. It has 256-bit AES encryption at rest, 128-bit AES encryption in transit, and two-factor authentication, and you can even wipe your device remotely if it gets stolen. You can also choose to host your data in a European data centre.</p><h3 id="3-Box-1"><a href="#3-Box-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Box"></a>3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unleash-HDR-Potential-The-Comprehensive-SDR-to-HDR-Conversion-Guide"><a href="#Unleash-HDR-Potential-The-Comprehensive-SDR-to-HDR-Conversion-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Unleash HDR Potential: The Comprehensive SDR-to-HDR Conversion Guide"></a>Unleash HDR Potential: The Comprehensive SDR-to-HDR Conversion Guide</h2><p><em>“I shot HDR video clips with the camera for my YouTube videos, but part of the footage is SDR, I hope to get a consistent video presentation, how could I do?”</em></p><p><em>So what do you do with all of your existing SDR content? To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software. Not every editor supports SDR to HDR conversion, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does, especially with new upgrades since the v.11.5.4 version. Upgrades are visible under BorisFX effects, like the improved split mode function, Denoise effects, etc.</p><p>Additionally, it supports almost all kinds of formats, like MP4, M4V, MPG, VOB, HDR, and WMV. The gamut of tools allows easy customization and editing of the HDR video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to Use Filmora for SDR Video to HDR Conversion?</strong></p><p>Step1Install and open Filmora software on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2Press the “New Project” choice.</p><p>Step3Access “Click here to import media” &gt; Insert the SDR-quality video file in MPEG-1&#x2F;MPEG-2&#x2F;MPEG-4 or other video file formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-1.jpg"                      alt="insert sdr video file"                ></p><p>Step4Drag the video to the editing timeline below.</p><p>Step5Make edits like audio ducking, keyframing, chroma key background removal, adding filters, etc.</p><p>Step6Open Effects &gt; BorisFX &gt; Download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-10.jpg"                      alt="open borisfx"                ></p><p>Step7Choose among the newer options like BCC Optical Diffusion, BCC Warp, and BCC Grads and Tints to upconvert to HDR quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-11.jpg"                      alt="upconvert to hdr quality"                ></p><p>Step8Click on the Export button.</p><p>Step9Choose the Local tab and choose the video format for exporting.

This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you’re looking to use MorphVOX, it’s paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what’s the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let’s find out!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-2.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don’t know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages.

Now you can download and install new voice packs conveniently from within the program. Just tap the <strong>Download</strong> button to download the voice pack.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-7.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro download voice pack"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, let’s set MorphVOX Pro to work on Skype.

One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program. If you are looking to add unique and fancy text to the video you are working on, then these text plugins for After Effects will come in handy.</p><h2 id="TextDelay"><a href="#TextDelay" class="headerlink" title="TextDelay"></a>TextDelay</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextDelay is a native plugin, meaning that you will find it already installed on After Effects. As the name suggests, you can use TextDelay to delay any other text transformations that you may add to the text and it allows you to delay these transformations by word, line, or even character. It comes with a range selector that allows you to have precise control over which characters can get the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-delay-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text delay plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextExploder"><a href="#TextExploder" class="headerlink" title="TextExploder"></a>TextExploder</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textexploder/" >https://aescripts.com/textexploder/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextExploder is an After Effects plugin that is developed by MamoWorld and it allows you to split the text layers in After Effects into words, lines, characters, and more. These splits are so powerful that you can very easily isolate a single word or even a single letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-exploder-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text exploder plugin"                ></p><h2 id="iExpressions-2"><a href="#iExpressions-2" class="headerlink" title="iExpressions 2"></a>iExpressions 2</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/" >https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to effectively use the After Effects expressions even if you are not familiar with coding, iExpressions 2 is the text plugin to consider. It comes with 22 ready-to-use iExpressions that you can easily customize to fit into your project and it is so easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/iexpression-2-plugin.jpg"                      alt="iexpression 2 plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextBox"><a href="#TextBox" class="headerlink" title="TextBox"></a>TextBox</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textbox/" >https://aescripts.com/textbox/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to create the perfect shape behind your text, then TextBox is a good text plugin to consider. This is a native After Effects plugin, meaning that you will not need to install it and the shapes it creates can be very easily customized. It updates the shapes you create automatically and adds them to the text layer, making it the most ideal solution to create closed captions, lower thirds, and subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-box-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text box plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Font-Manager"><a href="#Font-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Font Manager"></a>Font Manager</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/font-manager/" >https://aescripts.com/font-manager/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Font Manager is an After Effects text plugin that is useful when creating and working with animated typefaces. You can use it to create the most complex animated text graphics in just a few simple clicks. You will also find it very familiar to use as the user interface is similar to the Character Panel in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/font-manager-plugin.jpg"                      alt="font manager plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Cartoon-Moblur"><a href="#Cartoon-Moblur" class="headerlink" title="Cartoon Moblur"></a>Cartoon Moblur</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cartoon-moblur-plugin.jpg"                      alt="cartoon moblur plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Shadow-Studio"><a href="#Shadow-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Shadow Studio"></a>Shadow Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for shadow styles that will go very well with your project, Shadow Studio is a good plugin to get. It offers you a wide variety of shadow styles including radial, inner, soft, and long shadows. Most people find it an easier and more affordable way to add soft shadows as compared to traditional methods like raytracing. It is also quite easy to use, meaning that shadow effects that would take hours to complete can be done in a matter of minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/shadow-studio-plugin.jpg"                      alt="shadow studio plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Texts-Animation-Bundle"><a href="#Texts-Animation-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Texts Animation Bundle"></a>Texts Animation Bundle</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/" >https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is a bundle of more than 80 different templates to add text effects to any text in After Effects. All the templates in the bundle are easily customizable and the plugin is very easy to use, allowing you to create amazing text effects in just a few clicks. The templates are modeled from various titles, quotes, and stories, so there is a little bit of something for everyone. Plus, the bundle gets constant updates and you are likely to get new templates with each update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/texts-animation-bundle-plugin.jpg"                      alt="texts animation bundle plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Artificial-Intelligence-Titles"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence Titles"></a>Artificial Intelligence Titles</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s_rank=1" >https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s%5Frank=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Titles is an After Effects text plugin that is designed to be the ultimate typographical solution. Once you have it in After Effects, you can enter any text and the plugin will automatically adjust the entire layout of the text. You can choose to create awesome text boxes, change the color, add special effects and even change the duration, speed, size, and positioning of the text. It also allows users to customize the text animation’s direction without using a keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/artificial-intelligence-titles-plugin.jpg"                      alt="artificial intelligence titles plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Text-Library"><a href="#Text-Library" class="headerlink" title="Text Library"></a>Text Library</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974" >https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is another great text animation bundle with different options for just about any kind of project. But unlike other plugin bundles that only have a few effects to choose from, Text Library has thousands of templates to choose from.
