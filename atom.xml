Whether it’s your first time creating an HDR merge or you simply want to take advantage of the speed and accuracy that this software provides, using Lightroom HDR is a far more powerful and pleasant <a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/mobile.html" >mobile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://lightroom.adobe.com/" >web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible tool to create awesome high dynamic range photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-HDR-Images-in-Lightroom"><a href="#How-to-Create-HDR-Images-in-Lightroom" class="headerlink" title="How to Create HDR Images in Lightroom?"></a>How to Create HDR Images in Lightroom?</h2><p>You can use <strong>Lightroom HDR</strong> to properly balance images and provide high dynamic range and color vibrancy in pictures and videos. You can get high-quality images with no ghosting or bad alignment in the finished files and get enhanced visibility. In addition, features like <strong>Lightroom Enfuse</strong> are available for further editing.</p><p><strong>How to get high dynamic range photos with Lightroom?</strong></p><p>Step1Open the Lightroom software and right-click on the menu. On Mac PCs, press Ctrl + Mac icon.</p><p>Step2Hover your cursor on top of the “<strong>Photo Merge</strong>” option. From the drop-down menu, choose HDR.</p><p>Step3When the subsequent window loads in some time, tap the check mark beside the Auto Align option. All images will rearrange in an ordered sequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-1.jpg"                      alt="tap the check mark"                ></p><p>Step4Click on the Auto Tone feature to get shadow and highlight-related detailing.</p><p>Step5Adjust the Deghosting quantity from None to Medium or High.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-2.jpg"                      alt="adjust the deghosting quantity"                ></p><p>Step6Press Merge to export the HDR image. It will create one RAW file.</p><p>Step7Access the Develop module for further editing to the standard image file, changing elements like White&#x2F;Black points, Exposure, and Vibrance settings.</p><p>Step8Finally, save the file.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-HDR-Merge-in-Lightroom"><a href="#How-to-Use-HDR-Merge-in-Lightroom" class="headerlink" title="How to Use HDR Merge in Lightroom?"></a>How to Use HDR Merge in Lightroom?</h2><p>It is straightforward and usable for people to use the Lightroom HDR Merge function to add multiple images into a stack and prepare HDRs. The steps for that are simple to carry out, but you need to upgrade your software to the latest version first for the best results.</p><p><strong>How to perform HDR merge with Lightroom?</strong></p><p>Step1Open the Lightroom Classic software and control-click&#x2F;CMD all pictures you want to merge.</p><p>Step2Click on Photo &gt; Photo Merge. Then, choose the HDR option.</p><p>Alternatively, you can press the Ctrl and H keys on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-3.jpg"                      alt="click on photo and photo merge"                ></p><p>Step3When the HDR Merge Preview box opens, click the tick boxes beside Auto Tone and Auto Align to OFF. This is only if necessary, so see the previewed images to decide if you want to keep the default settings or not.</p><p>Step4In some of the exposure-bracketed pictures that merge, there are patches of semi-transparent spots in the HDR image. To avoid this, you can adjust deghosting between None and High, based on how many of the different artifacts you want to remove.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-4.jpg"                      alt="deghosting between none and high"                ></p><p>Step5Preview all changes and make further adjustments, if necessary.</p><p>Step6After the merging takes place, click on the Create Stack choice to group multiple exposure-bracketed images. After you do so, the HDR image will appear at the front position of the stacked images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-5.jpg"                      alt="click on the create stack choice"                ></p><p>Step7Click the Merge button to save the HDR photo as a .dng image file.</p><h2 id="Is-Lightroom-or-Photoshop-better-for-HDR"><a href="#Is-Lightroom-or-Photoshop-better-for-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightroom or Photoshop better for HDR?"></a>Is Lightroom or Photoshop better for HDR?</h2><p>Both Photoshop and Lightroom are suitable solutions for different improvements to image processing quality. But there are variations between these two Adobe productions.</p><h3 id="Lightroom-has-many-editing-pre-sets"><a href="#Lightroom-has-many-editing-pre-sets" class="headerlink" title="Lightroom has many editing pre-sets"></a>Lightroom has many editing pre-sets</h3><p>To note, many <strong>HDR Lightroom presets</strong> are available for more accessible editing work, like merging images after selecting multiple shots in the Library grid view. You can right-click on top of the chosen pictures and edit them in the HDR Pro (Photoshop) platforms. It will automatically begin the merging process.</p><h3 id="Lightroom-merges-in-HDR-Raw-format"><a href="#Lightroom-merges-in-HDR-Raw-format" class="headerlink" title="Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format"></a>Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format</h3><p>However, while Photoshop HDR Pro is notable for HDR-centric editing and merging, Lightroom allows users to merge the RAW files in the software into HDR RAW files. So, photographers using <strong>Lightroom HDR merge</strong> can customize the images better and provide higher dynamic range quality with no formatting change. On the other hand, Photoshop allows Photoshop PSD file type merging mainly.</p><h3 id="Photoshop-HDR-Pro-offers-8-bit-16-bit-32-bit-file-options"><a href="#Photoshop-HDR-Pro-offers-8-bit-16-bit-32-bit-file-options" class="headerlink" title="Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit&#x2F;32-bit file options"></a>Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit&#x2F;32-bit file options</h3><p>The Photoshop HDR Pro version allows 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit files. You can change them to 32-bit files by tapping the top-right section of this software window. Here, you can use the setting “Complete Toning in Adobe Raw” instead of operating the standard HDR editor controls. You can also control the ghosting mode here.</p><h3 id="Photoshop-vs-Lightroom-Deghosting-feature"><a href="#Photoshop-vs-Lightroom-Deghosting-feature" class="headerlink" title="Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature"></a>Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature</h3><p>On the other hand, features like <strong>Lightroom bracketing</strong> make it a suitable choice for photo editing. The HDR Merge Preview allows users to see the chosen images before any processing is started. The default settings for Deghost Amount, Auto Tone, and Auto Align are ticked, with the Deghost choice set as None.</p><p>After making any changes, you can tap the Merge button to complete the whole process. Lightroom automatically saves the image you merge in 32-bit .dng file format, adding a suffix-HDR to the file’s name. You can edit the standard file in the Develop environment later.</p><p>So, in terms of 32-bit processing, both products are helpful, but customization options are more with Photoshop.</p><p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons for Lightroom HDR</strong></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Automatically saves image files in 32.bit DNG format.</li><li>Better learning curve compared to the Photoshop HDR Pro version.</li><li>Easy load multiple bracketing images to do <strong>Lightroom HDR merge</strong> via the Library.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Does not include 8 and 16-bit options as default.</li><li>Blurry images are still possible after processing.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons for Photoshop HDR Pro</strong></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>No stand-alone software is necessary to use this feature.</li><li>More personalization benefits with 32-fit file editing.</li><li>You can use both editing and tone mapping functions separately and get realistic image looks.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>More artifacts that require extra cleaning can appear if there are many moving objects visible in one scene.</li><li>Beginners will struggle with this solution since it is relatively complex.</li></ul><h3 id="Comparison-Table-Between-Lightroom-and-Photoshop"><a href="#Comparison-Table-Between-Lightroom-and-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Table Between Lightroom and Photoshop"></a>Comparison Table Between Lightroom and Photoshop</h3><p>For a more precise understanding, here is a comparative overview of the HDR functionality in Adobe <strong>Lightroom HDR</strong> and Photoshop products.

That will take you some folders, and there should be a couple of Cache folders there. Open the Cache folder and look for files with an .mp3 extension. It can look like this (for a single downloaded podcast):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="download podcasts from a finder folder"                ></p><p>If you double click on that MP3, it plays a podcast. If this is something you may do often, copy that file path into a Notes document so you have it handy for next time. Or in the title bar of that window, click on the folder name and drag it to your sidebar so it creates a shortcut.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="copy that file path into a notes document"                ></p><h3 id="This-method-is-best-for-1"><a href="#This-method-is-best-for-1" class="headerlink" title="This method is best for"></a>This method is best for</h3><p>If you do not have a Podcast app on your iPhone, using your computer will work as a great alternative.

Therefore, other apps should not be used during recording because they can use computer bandwidth and cause video quality to decline. In addition, most Mac users have complained that the Photo Booth application freezes and crashes while recording a video or that it has a freezing&#x2F;lagging issue.</p><p>The program frequently freezes, even shortly after you start recording, indicating that it is not a problem caused by the video’s duration or size. Press the stop button to see the notorious “spinning wheel of death” or a Beach Ball symbol when you finish recording. As many users have experienced, you may encounter the following issues with Photo Booth.</p><ul><li>While capturing videos, Photo Booth freezes every 30 seconds.</li><li>The video recording in the Photo Booth is sluggish.</li><li>After capturing a picture, the Photo Booth freezes, and no picture appears.</li><li>The video and audio in the Photo Booth recording are out of sync.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing"><a href="#How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing" class="headerlink" title="How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?"></a>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</h2><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum. After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video file</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-1.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Organize the media</strong></p><p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the files you import into the editor. However, when searching for the video clips, you want to add to the timeline, working with many different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings. Learn more about video transitions and how to apply them in Filmora by watching this video tutorial.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Export and Share</strong></p><p>When you’re certain there’s nothing else you want to change or add to your project, click the Export button. You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported. Next, you can select the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-5.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</p><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum.

After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer-3"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor.

Nevertheless, the solutions are clear if the causes are unclear.</p><p>AirPod Pro has been experiencing this issue, but it can happen to any AirPods. They were working fine, and now one of them won’t work when you pop it in your ear.</p><p>The first AirPod we put in our ears tends to cause us to get it by chance. When the other AirPod is inserted, we hear that switched-on chime and know that the issue has recurred. If you face one Airpod not working problem and are looking for possible fixes, you are in the right place. In this article, we will not only guide you on how you can diagnose the problem with your AirPods when one side isn’t working, but we will also tell you some possible fixes using which you can make both your Airpods work again.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-call/how-to-facetime-on-android.html" >How to Use Facetime on Android(Everything About Using Facetime Links) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason"><a href="#One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason" class="headerlink" title="One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?"></a><strong>One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?</strong></h2><p>If one side of your AirPods is not working properly, it is a clear indication that something is wrong with your AirPods. If you dig deep into the causes of why this problem occurs, then you will find a range of reasons here. Anything can occur from reasonably simple causes like dirty AirPods and low battery to complex causes like audio settings and network issues. So, now it is clear that the AirPods issue cannot be caused by one single cause, nor can it be fixed by a single solution.</p><h2 id="One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Possible-Fixes"><a href="#One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Possible-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Possible Fixes?"></a><strong>One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Possible Fixes?</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Check-If-There-is-An-Battery-Issue"><a href="#1-Check-If-There-is-An-Battery-Issue" class="headerlink" title="1. Check If There is An Battery Issue"></a>1. Check If There is An Battery Issue</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/one-airpod-fix1-battery.png"                      alt="one-airpod-fix1-battery"                ></p><p>If both AirPods are plugged in, and only one of them is working properly, then the first and the simplest problem causing this would be the battery problem. It is very likely that the not working AirPod is dead, and that’s why it is not working now. When using AirPods, be mindful that the batteries of both sides of Airpods drain at different rates. So, when one side is not working, don’t forget to check your battery widget and charge the AirPods to make them work again.</p><h4 id="2-Clean-Your-AirPods"><a href="#2-Clean-Your-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Your AirPods"></a>2. Clean Your AirPods</h4><p>When you use the AirPods more frequently than it is common to have junk built up in it, it could also be the reason why you do not hear the sound on one side of your AirPods. Dust, Lint, and earwax can form a built-up in your AirPods over time and then can block the sound from getting out of your AirPods. As a result, you think that your AirPods are not working properly. So, there is a very simple fix to this problem. All you need to do is, check the AirPods to see if the speakers look clogged. If you find something clogged in your speakers, then clean them properly and use them again. They will work perfectly.</p><h4 id="3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off"><a href="#3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Bluetooth On and Off"></a>3.

In that case, a very simple fix could be trying to reset the Bluetooth. Just go to the settings in your iPhone or iPad and click on Bluetooth. Turn off the BlueTooth slider from Bluetooth settings and wait for a while. Now turn it back on and check again if the problem is fixed or not.</p><h4 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h4><p>Despite the lack of certainty that restarting will solve the problem, restarting is straightforward and quick, so it’s worth trying. By restarting a device, the active memory is cleared out, and problems are usually resolved. So you can try restarting your iPad or iPhone if one AirPod is not working. Restarting your device is very simple; all you need to do is, press the power button and then slide from left to right to turn off your device. Once the device is turned off, you can simply turn it back on using the power button.</p><h4 id="5-Unpair-and-Re-pair-AirPods"><a href="#5-Unpair-and-Re-pair-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="5.

You need to set up your AirPods again. You can make AirPods disappear by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth &gt; tapping i next to the AirPods &gt; Forget This Device &gt; Forget device. By doing so, your AirPods are no longer connected to your device. Next, put the AirPods into the case and hold down the button on the case. Then follow the instructions on the screen to set up the AirPods.</p><h4 id="6-Reset-Network-Settings"><a href="#6-Reset-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Reset Network Settings"></a>6.

It could be your settings that are malfunctioning. To reset the Network Settings, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings.

Though it may be a low-grade virtual reality, the thing is, it’s still VR. Google has a platform wherein you can open your android phone into a cut-rate VR viewer called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The focus of this app is mostly put on games and experiences but it also empowers VR videos which are lightly immersed.</p><p>When your android phone has a VR viewer, you can have your own freedom of watching and looking around the world for 360-degree videos. Whether you’re watching an animated trippy clip, savoring a concert footage, watching stunts from all sides and angles; with VR viewer, it would feel like you’re actually among the crowd or in the place as the ones you’re watching. VR viewers like Google Cardboard makes the experience of watching videos less passive and creates new ways of visual storytelling.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">2.Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part3">3.Watching Local Videos on Android</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos"></a>Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</h2><p>The first distinction between VR and 360 Videos is that 360 videos can be watched and viewed with Cardboard and other VR handsets but 360 videos aren’t just like VR videos because VR videos with the right content has the depth of illusion.</p><p><strong>VR videos</strong> are stereoscopic 3D (has a different right and left eye point of view) which means these VR videos are providing added immersion by giving the sense of being on place in the world you’re watching such as nearby close-up objects while further items seem to off and far away. This only sounds like a very subtle difference between a 360 video and a VR video but in addition, the 3D quality is better used on VR handsets and can be justified by just placing your android phone up your eyes.</p><p>However, <strong>360 videos</strong> act mostly in the same manner. With the use of a phone’s gyroscope, it will let you look around as you take footage and they can still be viewed via VR viewer in good quality. Most cases show that non-VR video contents seem to be actually sharper when viewed on Cardboard. That’s why sometimes, depth is swapped with clarity whenever you choose between VR and 360 videos.</p><p>The higher frame rate and resolution of 360 videos and VR videos result to more pleasurable video experience especially via Cardboard. Videos with lower frame rate can actually add blurry artifacts which can then cause you to be a bit nauseous while watching the video. Nasty blurs can affect the focus of your eye that’s why you may feel nauseous. Opt for VR and 360 videos that have options of maximum quality when streaming. It’s okay if it needs more bandwidth. Just try finding the best versions and quality local videos whenever possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android"></a>Part 2. Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</h2><p>Google Cardboard is letting you experience the fun and simple way into virtual reality. Through Google Cardboard and YouTube app on mobile android phones, the immersive experience of watching 360 videos is made possible.</p><ul><li>Have Google Cardboard and then assemble it.</li><li>Open your YouTube app on your mobile phone.</li><li>Proceed to the 360Video House Channel and search for “#360Video” and visit the channel. You’re in the right channel if you see this avatar.</li><li>Choose a video you want to play on the channel then start playback.</li><li>When you tap this Cardboard icon, the screen will split into two screens.</li><li>Insert your mobile phone into the Cardboard.</li><li>Look around and view your chosen video in 360 degrees.</li></ul><h5 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><p>In order to use Cardboard with your iOS devices, be sure to have iOS 9 or later.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Watching-Local-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Watching-Local-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Watching Local Videos on Android"></a>Part 3. Watching Local Videos on Android</h2><p>To watch local videos on your android phone, you can choose to download 360 video or VR video from a website that is compatible for your android device and software like Kolor eyes. You can easily play your local video files on your android phones as long as you have the right VR or 360 video app that will make your video experience even better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-chromatic-chameleons-playbook-for-masters/"><u>2024 Approved  The Chromatic Chameleon's Playbook for Masters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-magic-creating-breathtaking-gopro-time-lapse-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock the Magic  Creating Breathtaking GoPro Time-Lapse Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-mastering-multi-tasking-with-your-favorite-talk-shows/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Multi-Tasking With Your Favorite Talk Shows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-powerdirector-24-review-a-comprehensive-dive/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate PowerDirector '24 Review  A Comprehensive Dive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-cd-manipulation-with-wmp/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamlining Cd Manipulation with WMP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-insiders-pathway-to-effective-auditory-notes/"><u>2024 Approved  The Insider’s Pathway to Effective Auditory Notes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unraveling-the-discrepant-nature-of-vr-and-full-sphere-capture/"><u>2024 Approved  Unraveling the Discrepant Nature of VR and Full Sphere Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essence-of-shareable-humorous-content/"><u>In 2024, The Essence of Shareable Humorous Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-zeo-startup-showcase/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Zeo-Startup Showcase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-quantum-hdr-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Quantum HDR for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cutting-edge-music-editing-software-roundup-the-top-10-compatible-apps-for-windows-and-mac/"><u>New 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Music Editing Software Roundup The Top 10 Compatible Apps for Windows and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-insta-stardom-15-effortless-steps-towards-rapid-and-sustained-fame-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Insta Stardom  15 Effortless Steps Towards Rapid and Sustained Fame for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-install-splice-on-your-mac-for-professional-video-editing/"><u>New In 2024, Install Splice on Your Mac for Professional Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-sports-intro-and-youtube-endscreen-in-2024/"><u>Updated How to Create Sports Intro and YouTube Endscreen, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/top-10-ultra-hd-capture-tools-for-screen-recording/"><u>Top 10 Ultra-HD Capture Tools for Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-poco-x5-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring Poco X5 to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/youtube-music-blend-fundamentals/"><u>YouTube Music Blend Fundamentals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-on-tecno-pop-7-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What to Do if Google Play Services Keeps Stopping on Tecno Pop 7 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-industry-standards-in-digital-media-capture/"><u>[Updated] Industry Standards in Digital Media Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fcpx-mastery-learn-the-top-40-keyboard-shortcuts/"><u>New In 2024, FCPX Mastery Learn the Top 40 Keyboard Shortcuts</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, the sad part is that the audio signal suffers from distortion when mics are connected through protective cases. Moreover, waterproof cases never even allow access to mic ports directly.</p><p>In such cases, we need to buy additional protective cases or frames that can allow easy connectivity with audio ports. As the latest designs of GoPro do not possess audio jack so in that case you need a microphone adapter to capture sound without distortion.</p><p>Below are few details about some of the <strong>best microphones that can be used with Action Cameras</strong> to achieve improvement over sound quality.

They are small in size and can be easily attached to clothing while keeping hands free. These mics are also called as tie-clip mics or lapel mics. Lavalier mics are most suitable for the voice that is in close proximity whereas they cannot be used for ambient music.</p><p>On the other side, <strong>shotgun mics</strong> are developed to serve medium angle shots with impressive results. They assist in better focusing while avoiding the off-axis noise and improve performance with its tight polar pattern. These mics can be easily used for outdoor shooting needs as they can resist wind.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no doubt to say that you can find huge varieties of microphones in the market for GoPro devices. But your selection must be fair and careful. A good quality microphone offers decent functionality with impressive audio quality. Some of these products allow Bluetooth connectivity so that audio signals can be recorded from distance places whereas others are connected through wires. You can easily pick any design out of all discussed above as per your budget and needs. All these products can be ordered from Amazon at a decent price range.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more about Action Camera Accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-visualizer-speedster-for-windows-10/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Visualizer - Speedster for Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-psychology-behind-successful-facebook-gifting-campaigns/"><u>[New] The Psychology Behind Successful Facebook Gifting Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-full-potential-of-zoom-in-windows-10/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock Full Potential of Zoom in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-newcomers-notebook-navigating-through-pixel-perfect-videos-for-2024/"><u>The Newcomer’s Notebook  Navigating Through Pixel-Perfect Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-trip-diary-into-haul-video-hype/"><u>[New] Transform Your Trip Diary Into Haul Video Hype</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-insiders-handbook-acquiring-high-quality-cost-free-images/"><u>[New] The Insider's Handbook  Acquiring High-Quality, Cost-Free Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-list-of-no-cost-vectors-and-design-portals-online/"><u>[New] Ultimate List of No-Cost Vectors and Design Portals Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-11-pro-max-to-an-older-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone 11 Pro Max to an Older Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-emulator-selections-for-mobile-gba-players/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Emulator Selections for Mobile GBA Players</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-android-and-iphone-collage-kings-the-best-montage-apps/"><u>[New] Android & iPhone Collage Kings  The Best Montage Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-tecno-spark-20-pro-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Tecno Spark 20 Pro to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-from-end-to-start-on-instagram-vids-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From End to Start on Instagram Vids [Guide] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-strategies-for-developing-captivating-audio-visual-teasers/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Strategies for Developing Captivating Audio-Visual Teasers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-make-your-whatsapp-status-stand-out-with-these-video-maker-tools-for-2024/"><u>Updated Make Your WhatsApp Status Stand Out with These Video Maker Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-new-wins-for-windows-11-users/"><u>[Updated] New Wins for Windows 11 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-vrecorder-unpacked-step-by-step-download-procedures/"><u>[New] VRecorder Unpacked  Step-by-Step Download Procedures</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This auto-unlock feature is one of the most requested features available on the eye watch. What it basically entails is that when using a Mac with OS sierra you can automatically unlock your devices within certain proximity using your Apple watch. This could mean that you could do away with passwords as well as have a whole other level of access control and features via linking together the two devices. Having the ability to use auto-unlock can take some time to put up but by crossing over your mac OS and your apple watch, you can generate access for your Macintosh computer and devices much faster.</p><p>This could be a big help for automatically being able to use your Macintosh computer without even having to log into your accounts. The linked accounts on your Apple watch could also be carried over to the computer ensuring that well you are in close proximity you don’t have to use a number of the password for your accounts.</p><h2 id="The-process-of-setting-up-this-verification-is-relatively-simple"><a href="#The-process-of-setting-up-this-verification-is-relatively-simple" class="headerlink" title="The process of setting up this verification is relatively simple"></a>The process of setting up this verification is relatively simple</h2><p>The first step is to enable two-factor authentication on your Apple ID account. After enabling the two-step authentication on your local device and turning it off on your account you can set up the authentication option as your smartwatch.</p><p>Head over to applied.apple.com and edit the security section to turn off two-step verification using the online service. After turning the two-step verification process off you can then go to your local device and consider turning on the authentication process on your Macintosh computer.</p><p>To turn on two-factor authentication on a Mac you need to click on the Apple icon, go to system preferences, the I cloud button and then the security pane to turn on two-factor authentication services. By enabling two-factor authentication and disabling the two-step verification you can open your computer up to the idea of auto-unlock.</p><p>After this initial set up you can set up the auto-unlock feature on your Mac:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>Set up a passcode on your Apple watch and make sure that it’s running watch OS3. The watch icon on your iPhone, go to my watch, passcode and turn on the passcode. Pick a passcode you can remember and set this as the password for your apple watch.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>On your Macintosh computer open up the system preferences tab. Go to security and privacy and search for the checkbox to allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac. You will be asked to enter in your Macintosh is password and then the screen will prompt a turning on message. After the turning on set up has completed, let your mac go to sleep.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Open your mac from sleep. This process should be as simple as wearing your Apple watch and opening up your Macintosh computer. Your mac should display a wake message that says unlocking with Apple watch on screen.

What is a WebP file?"></a>1. What is a WebP file?</h4><p>WebP is a new type of image format developed by Google that offers both lossy and lossless compression ratio while maintaining the quality of the photo at the same time. Such pictures occupy less space on the web servers, and load comparatively faster when opened in a web browser, thus saving the Internet bandwidth.</p><h4 id="2-Why-you-should-use-WebP-format"><a href="#2-Why-you-should-use-WebP-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Why you should use WebP format?"></a>2. Why you should use WebP format?</h4><p>Since WebP files are smaller in size but still offer high picture quality, you should use the format if you are a site owner and want to utilize the web space optimally. The format also saves users’ Internet bandwidth by loading comparatively sooner on the Internet browser while surfing the web.</p><h4 id="3-Why-can’t-I-open-WebP-format-on-Windows-10-Photos"><a href="#3-Why-can’t-I-open-WebP-format-on-Windows-10-Photos" class="headerlink" title="3. Why can’t I open WebP format on Windows 10 Photos?"></a>3. Why can’t I open WebP format on Windows 10 Photos?</h4><p>WebP files are primarily prepared for web interface, and the default association of the *.webp extension is with your web browser. Since the Photos app in Windows 10 only supports image (and sometime video) files, you need an efficient <strong>WebP to JPG</strong> converter to first convert the pictures to JPG format, and then open them in the Photos app that Windows 10 has.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-Open-WebP-on-Windows-10-and-Mac-s"><a href="#4-How-to-Open-WebP-on-Windows-10-and-Mac-s" class="headerlink" title="4. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s"></a>4. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s</h4><p>Because WebP files are intended to be used on the web, you can use your default Internet browser (Microsoft Edge for Windows and Safari for Mac) to view the images. However, if you want to open the photos like any other picture, you need to <strong>convert WebP to JPG</strong> before you can do so.</p><p>5. <strong>How to convert photos to PDF?</strong></p><p><a

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

Designers rely on their practical experience to guide them, regardless of their level of schooling. If you have the desire to always learn new things and challenge yourself, you may be a graphic artist at heart. Although it’s a fascinating industry to enter, many aspiring designers can become bogged down in the early stages. This article will examine the profession of graphic design before outlining the ten stages necessary to become one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/graphic-design-career.jpg"                      alt="graphic design career"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing"><a href="#Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing"></a>Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing</h2><p>You must have a thorough understanding of graphic design principles before you can become a graphic designer. A well-made design takes time to create. It takes extensive planning as well as knowledge of how to apply design philosophy and principles. Lines, color, shape, space, texture, typography, scale, dominance and emphasis, and harmony are all factors that graphic designers must consider. Each of these factors has an effect on a design and influences how an audience feels. Here are a few methods to get started:</p><p><strong>Take a graphic design course</strong></p><p>A graphic design course teaches you the principles of design and aids in your skill development by having you work on projects. You’ll meet peers and mentors through graphic design courses, and they’ll be useful as you expand your network. Topics including color theory, typography, layout, and graphic design tools and software will likely be covered in the majority of graphic design courses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/take-graphic-design-course.jpg"                      alt="take graphic design course"                ></p><p>Some courses may also instruct you on the history of graphic design, user experience (UX), and website design principles, depending on their depth. There are several alternatives, ranging from academic courses with rigid structure to more flexible online courses. Find one that fits your learning style and timetable.</p><p><strong>Practice your design skills</strong></p><p>Remember, practice makes perfect. It’s time to put your newfound knowledge of graphic design ideas and tools into practice. Working on your own design projects is the best approach to develop your abilities and become a master of graphic design software. You might start by making imitation advertisements and company logos for real or imagined businesses.</p><p>In order to discover and design for target consumers, you may also use a current company’s designs as inspiration for a new design. Volunteering for regional nonprofits or businesses is another choice. Give these organizations your design expertise to obtain additional practice and practical experience.</p><p><strong>Create a portfolio</strong></p><p>Any graphic designer must have a strong portfolio. Projects you did for a course as well as personal or professional projects can be included in your portfolio. Pay attention to quality over quantity. Since your portfolio will serve as potential employers’ or clients’ initial impression of you, choose pieces that highlight your design expertise and passions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Find-Clients"><a href="#Part-2-Find-Clients" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Find Clients"></a>Part 2. Find Clients</h2><p>It’s crucial to land your first customers as quickly as you can. This will help you launch your company and give you the confidence and drive you need. You might try looking for clients on freelance job websites or use your personal network. Find out if your friends, co-workers, or family members know of anyone looking for a graphic designer. Here are some great places we find valuable to find potential graphic design clients:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-graphic-design-clients-online.jpg"                      alt="find graphic design clients online"                ></p><p><strong>UpWork</strong></p><p>Upwork, which has long been favored by the freelance community, gives its members a location to locate new clients to support small businesses. Upwork should undoubtedly be on your list if you’re looking to connect with new clients because of its innovative matching system, which connects jobs to applicants with the highest-rated work and guarantees a wide range of chances and high pay.</p><p><strong>Behance</strong></p><p>Behance, an Adobe creation, is the top website for designers to display their original work. With social features like the ability to comment on and “like” items, as well as a jobs board, it gives businesses the chance to look for talent on a worldwide scale. The best part is that it functions as an online, visual CV and is totally free.</p><p><strong>OneSite</strong></p><p>OnSite presents itself as a platform for top-notch, hand-picked independent contractors with no middleman and no commission. Users are connected with tasks appropriate to their talents and a marketplace of freelancing opportunities is provided. Only “high quality talent” with established client and agency experience is accepted, serving as a barrier between the designer and the client.</p><p><strong>Elance</strong></p><p>Elance is a community for creative freelancers looking for work and will soon join the Upwork family. With the help of its Enterprise feature, it may connect sizable teams of independent contractors for collaborative working in addition to matching a client with a designer.</p><p><strong>Toptal</strong></p><p>Toptal is a US-based company that connects businesses in need of freelance skills with designers. The website lists a variety of globally known businesses with whom one can establish ongoing working ties, with the caveat that it will only accept “excellent freelancers.”</p><p><strong>iFreelance</strong></p><p>On iFreelance, which bills itself as “the leading place for independent professionals looking for freelance work,” you can network with small- and big-business owners and market your graphic design expertise.</p><p><strong>Project4hir</strong></p><p>A freelance marketplace called Project4Hire links hiring clients with experts and workers all across the world. Clients publish their project specifications, and freelancers respond with quotes or bids outlining how much they would charge to do the task or provide the service. At any time, clients can choose the freelancers they want to work with and start a project with them.</p><p><strong>SimplyHired</strong></p><p>Online hiring is made possible by the website and mobile app Simply Hired. Although primarily geared at full-time employment, it also offers the chance to find companies in need of design assistance, giving you the opportunity to obtain that all-important first foot in the door.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Much-Do-Graphic-Designers-Get-Paid"><a href="#Part-3-How-Much-Do-Graphic-Designers-Get-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Much Do Graphic Designers Get Paid?"></a>Part 3. How Much Do Graphic Designers Get Paid?</h2><p>You possess the motivation, determination, and perhaps even some technical know-how. But when it comes to graphic design, one key question often comes to mind: Will you be able to support yourself as a graphic designer?</p><p>Yes, you’re interested in the average salary of graphic designers, but you also have a lot of other pressing inquiries that require a response. Before deciding to pursue this creative career, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the position if you want to make an informed decision.</p><p>What does a graphic designer get paid? What abilities are necessary for graphic designers to succeed? How does one become one, too? All of these questions have answers, in addition to others. Discover the information you need to decide if a career in graphic design is a good fit for you by continuing to read.</p><p>When analyzing graphic designer pay data, there are many different things to take into account. Earning potential might vary depending on a number of factors, including education, location, expertise, job situation, and more. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median annual wage for graphic designers was $53,380 in 2020.</p><p>You can see that these creative professionals make a good livelihood by comparing that to the $41,950 national average for all occupations. The prospective earnings of graphic designers might also be influenced by the industry they work in. The BLS reports that the median annual compensation for graphic designers working in the advertising, public relations, and allied services sector in 2020 was slightly higher ($55,800) than that of graphic designers employed in other common industries like printing and publishing.</p><p>The following countries are great for graphic designers:</p><p><strong>The United Kingdom</strong></p><p>In the UK, business is booming in the design sector. In actuality, the design and designer fashion sectors’ gross value added (GVA) reached £2.52 billion, or $3.35 billion, in 2018. With many top-tier agencies based in London and Glasgow, the UK is one of the world’s major design hubs.</p><p>The UK is one of the most alluring nations for American designers for a number of reasons. There are no linguistic obstacles, on the one hand. However, the cost of living in the UK is 12.21% lower than it is in the US. It implies that housing costs are lower there. However, one of the nations with the highest incomes for graphic design is the United Kingdom. The best paid cities are the bigger ones like London, where the average yearly wage is $72,500.</p><p><strong>Canada</strong></p><p>Despite having a relatively tiny population for such a vast country in terms of area, Canada does have a vibrant design culture. The national average compensation for graphic designers is $48,750 per year. As in other countries, the necessity to streamline brand assets across numerous media has increased demand for designers, especially those with expertise in multiple design disciplines.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>According to an interesting fact, China had the highest percentage of smartphone users in the world in 2020. It surpasses Indonesia, the United States, and India with a penetration rate of 60.75 percent. China has a sizable and loyal mobile user base. Mobile design and development are thus one of the top objectives in the nation.</p><p>Particularly Shenzhen is a recognized design capital and one of the top cities for innovation and the creative industries. It has financing to support local startups and is recognized as a City of Design. Using the Creative Cities Network.</p><p>In Shenzhen, 6,000 design firms employ almost 100,000 workers. Graphic designers in China get an average salary of $1276 per year, according to Payscale. Chinese graphic design salaries are lower than those in the US.</p><p>The Red Dragon, on the other hand, has a lower cost of living than America—in fact, it is 34.1 percent less expensive. You would make a good living and have a big wage if you moved to the country.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>Israel’s entrepreneurial community is flourishing. In fact, among the top 30 worldwide startup ecosystems and runners-up, Tel Aviv comes in at number six. This makes it an appealing option for many design industry experts, especially when combined with the nation’s high-tech mindset.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Choose-the-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Choose-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Choose the Software"></a>Part 4. Choose the Software</h2><p>The best graphic design software for you might depend on your needs, but if you work with a variety of clients and require a wide range of features, you might want to stick with one of the most well-known programs. Based on our own assessments, we’ve selected the best graphic design software currently on the market. This list includes everything from general-purpose software packages to specialized solutions for specialized markets. We have created a list for you to check out when looking for graphic designer software.</p><p><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></p><p>There isn’t much reason to seek further if you want the greatest graphic design program for vector drawing and editing. Adobe Illustrator. For a good reason—we think it still provides the most robust selection of tools and functionality for vector editing—it is still the industry standard software.</p><p>Illustrator lets you to design everything from graphics to logos with complete creative freedom while having a ton of tools and shortcuts to help speed up your workflow. It is compatible with PC, Mac, and even iPads. We were happy with several of the improvements Adobe made to maintain their throne, including the ability to customize the toolbar, Rotate View, and a Width Tool that makes it simple to add variations to vector lines.</p><p><strong>Affinity Designer</strong></p><p>Serif’s Affinity Designer is a very capable substitute if you think Adobe’s membership pricing structure is a touch too much. Affinity Designer is the best graphic design software you can buy for a one-time fee, and as it continues to add capabilities, it is almost on par with Illustrator in popularity. In fact, it provides various tools not found in Illustrator, such as unlimited redo’s and a zoom of more than one million percent.</p><p>If coworkers or clients use Adobe products, you don’t have to worry about compatibility because Affinity Designer supports both Illustrator AI and Photoshop PSD files. Affinity Designer probably runs quicker than Adobe Illustrator as well.</p><p><strong>CorelDRAW</strong></p><p>Although Adobe Illustrator gained some of CorelDRAW’s early popularity, it still has a devoted following, and the software’s 2021 update brought about several significant improvements. A Mac version (opens in new tab), which was previously only available for Windows, became available in 2019, helping to increase the package’s appeal by adding many of Illustrator’s features at a somewhat lower cost. Since you have the option of making a one-time payment or a subscription, you also have additional financial flexibility.</p><p>In spite of this, importing and exporting AI and PDF files to CorelDRAW is trouble-free. However, you should select one over the other mostly because you like the interface and process better. We advise joining up for the free trials of both if you haven’t used either before or have the opportunity to compare them.</p><p><strong>Gravit Designer</strong></p><p>The best free vector-specific graphic design program comes from the makers of Corel Draw and is called Gravit Designer. It can handle the majority of design tasks, from icon design and prototyping to vector drawing and animation, thanks to its clear and user-friendly interface. With the free version, you can access your work from anywhere using the Gravit Cloud and export files as PDF, SVG, or bitmaps.</p><p>You can download a copy of Gravit Designer or use it online. When you sign up, Gravit Designer Pro automatically starts as a free trial; after that, you automatically switch to the free edition, losing the pro capabilities unless you pay for a subscription.</p><p><strong>SVG-Edit</strong></p><p>Using a common vector toolkit, SVG-Edit enables you to edit and generate SVG files. No download is necessary because the software operates directly in your web browser. It isn’t the most complete vector software, but that isn’t really necessary. It will work just fine for vectors that are straightforward or even a little more intricate.</p><p><strong>VectorStyler</strong></p><p>The best vector software includes VectorStyler, a very recent addition. It was initially exclusively accessible for Mac, but it is now also available for Windows. A large selection of scalable vector brushes and the addition of some capabilities that are absent from other Adobe Illustrator competitors, like a form builder, a blend tool, and a pattern tool, are some of its main selling points. It can open and import Illustrator files, and you can import AI brush collections, make vector brushes out of artwork, and dynamically link brush content to editable artwork. You can even generate vector brushes from scratch.</p><p><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></p><p>Most likely, you already know that Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard program for manipulating images. The program has long been well-known, and just as Illustrator continues to be the greatest vector design software due to its frequent improvements, Photoshop continues to rule in picture manipulation.</p><p>In actuality, it is capable of far more than just image manipulation, including photo retouching, digital painting and drawing, 3D modeling, and user experience design. It is a fully functional program, and Adobe has been expanding its arsenal of AI capabilities under the Adobe Sensei brand so that you can quickly and easily remove backdrops, for example.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Working-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-5-Working-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Working in Teams"></a>Part 5. Working in Teams</h2><p>The effort of several specialists with expertise in disciplines like graphic design, animation, and coding is frequently required for today’s designs. Whether you’re working on a project with two individuals or twenty, improving your team design strategy will streamline your operations and produce better results. Although the skills and personality of your team members may affect how projects are designed, you can usually rely on the following procedures to increase the effectiveness of your work.</p><p>During the team design project, don’t presume that everyone will play a particular position. Knowing everyone’s strengths can help you assign work to them as you progress through the design phases rather than making them sit idle.</p><p>Your illustrator may have prior animation experience. Your illustrator may even have expertise with development in the workplace of today. Even though they lack the necessary expertise to create a website or app, they could be able to advance the project’s initial phase with their rudimentary understanding. The team’s workflow will be accelerated, and your job satisfaction as an illustrator will increase.</p><p>Some people may feel isolated as a result of team design. They might eventually begin to procrastinate on their work, arrive at meetings a little late, or forget to check their messages. Negative feedback would be used in a conventional project management strategy to hold team members accountable.</p><p>You might have to huddle up with some individuals as the project manager to criticize their mistakes. But really, that ought to be your final resort. Utilize positive reinforcement prior to using negative reinforcement to keep team members motivated and appreciated.</p><p>You might not always have the opportunity to assemble your team in one location as more businesses migrate staff and independent contractors to remote employment. The warmth of in-person collaboration will be missed by some. However, working remotely is growing common. Even once the coronavirus pandemic is over, almost 70% of business owners anticipate letting at least some of their staff work remotely.</p><p>On any design job, effective communication is essential. However, if you can’t solve the fundamental issues with remote working, no amount of communication will be of any use. Some of us are entering a completely new world. It’s still beneficial to learn more about how you may succeed in a remote work setting with a team of graphic designers in particular, even if you’ve been working remotely for some time.</p><p>Leading a team at work involves more than just ensuring that everyone provides for your needs. The best managers pay close attention to the long-term requirements of those under their control. Give your team members the resources and opportunities they require to achieve their own professional goals if you want to get the most out of them. Assist them in finding a path that has upward momentum.</p><p>Understanding the individuals you deal with and allocating tasks based on that understanding are both important aspects of managing your graphic design team effectively. Try to assign assignments as much as you can based on who would be the best fit for the job. While some tasks must be completed regardless of whether they are fun or not, doing too much tedious work makes people lose interest in their employment.</p><p>A crucial component of creative activity is engaging others in their work. In general, employees who are more invested in their work will perform better over time.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The world of graphic design depends on relationships with other people to advance. Therefore, being really nice and engaged will undoubtedly advance your career. Simply put, communication and relationship-building are essential to our line of work, so you can’t avoid them. One last bit of advice is to keep going. Continue phoning, sending emails, or doing whatever else you do regularly. Reject jealousy and don’t take rejection personally. A rejection today can lead to a job tomorrow or a future new client.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-timelessly-taken-selfies-from-the-bygone-era/"><u>2024 Approved  Timelessly Taken  Selfies From the Bygone Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-the-secrets-of-a-captivating-end-episode-note/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking the Secrets of a Captivating End-Episode Note</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-artistic-zoomers-handbook-a-filters-journey/"><u>In 2024, The Artistic Zoomer's Handbook  A Filters Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unprecedented-capacity-choices-elite-cloud-services/"><u>2024 Approved  Unprecedented Capacity Choices  Elite Cloud Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-speed-in-facebook-videos-the-best-tools-and-tips/"><u>[New] Unleashing Speed in Facebook Videos  The Best Tools and Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-edge-testing-gopros-hero5-black-against-sessions-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Edge  Testing GoPro's Hero5 Black Against Sessions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-adding-time-markers-on-youtubes/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Adding Time Markers on YouTubes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/unlock-the-secrets-of-9gag-for-memetic-success-for-2024/"><u>Unlock the Secrets of 9GAG for Memetic Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-top-voice-changer-app-magic-call-and-its-alternatives/"><u>[Updated] Top Voice Changer App  Magic Call and Its Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-mvps-of-frugal-filmmaking-tech-for-2024/"><u>The MVPs of Frugal Filmmaking Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-voice-generating-services-with-zero-cost-top-9-pick/"><u>Updated In 2024, Voice Generating Services with Zero Cost – Top 9 Pick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-exclusive-hd-benefits-turn-on-av1-in-youtube-settings/"><u>In 2024, Exclusive HD Benefits  Turn On AV1 in YouTube Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-pause-life360-location-sharing-for-vivo-y17s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Pause Life360 Location Sharing For Vivo Y17s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-a-visual-guide-to-building-believable-characters-in-virtual-space/"><u>[Updated] A Visual Guide to Building Believable Characters in Virtual Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-sky-high-quality-with-your-iphone-camera-essential-tips-top-8/"><u>In 2024, Sky-High Quality with Your iPhone Camera  Essential Tips (Top 8)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-retrieve-erased-call-logs-from-13t-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>How to retrieve erased call logs from 13T Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-6-superior-android-screen-capture-apps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  6 Superior Android Screen Capture Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mp4-video-repair-tool-repair-corrupt-damaged-unplayable-video-files-of-honor-x7b-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>MP4 Video Repair Tool -

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.vive.com/" >HTC Vive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem. The headset has over 70 sensors to allow for 360 degrees head tracking and it also boasts of a 90Hz refresh rate responsible for keeping down the latency, which in turn saves the users from suffering motions sickness. This headset is currently available for purchase from $799.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" >Samsung Gear VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gear-vr.png"                      alt="gear-vr"                ></p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is essentially Oculus Rift lite, owing to the fact that the two companies worked on the technology together. The Gear VR uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for the display and as the processor. The phone slots in front of the lenses and into a Micro USB slot, and uses the super AMOLED display as the screen. With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/" >Oculus Rift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" >Sony PlayStation VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a><a class="link"   href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-subtext-converting-srt-to-sub/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Subtext  Converting SRT to SUB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-full-potential-with-powerdirector-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Full Potential with PowerDirector - A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-2023s-enhanced-sony-s3700-overview/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling 2023'S Enhanced Sony S3700 Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-creativity-with-these-free-web-photo-editors/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Creativity with These Free Web Photo Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-bg-deletion-in-figma/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to BG Deletion in Figma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-the-mystery-behind-apples-m1-chip/"><u>[Updated] Unraveling the Mystery Behind Apple's M1 Chip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-iphonepcs-full-potential-with-these-top-8-converters/"><u>[Updated] Unlock iPhone/PC's Full Potential With These Top 8 Converters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-syncing-your-favorite-tunes-moving-playlists-across-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved  Syncing Your Favorite Tunes  Moving Playlists Across Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unblemished-visuals-a-buyers-ultimate-guide/"><u>In 2024, Unblemished Visuals  A Buyer's Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/demystifying-the-money-behind-1m-on-youtube/"><u>Demystifying the Money Behind 1M on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-alluring-beauty-of-cutting-edge-sound-editing-tools-evaluating-pros-cons-and-competitive-landscapes/"><u>2024 Approved The Alluring Beauty of Cutting-Edge Sound Editing Tools Evaluating Pros, Cons, and Competitive Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/groove-gatherers-try-our-cost-free-beats-scanners/"><u>Groove Gatherers  Try Our Cost-Free Beats Scanners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/leveraging-instagram-stories-with-ease-and-flair/"><u>Leveraging Instagram Stories with Ease and Flair</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-8-plus-with-an-apple-watch-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesnt-work-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 Plus With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesnt Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-audio-precision-the-foremost-4-music-editors-for-mac/"><u>Updated Audio Precision – The Foremost 4 Music Editors for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-sfx-seekers-companion-navigating-to-8-exceptional-online-locations-for-accessing-premium-quality-no-cost-audio-assets/"><u>2024 Approved The SFX Seekers Companion Navigating to 8 Exceptional Online Locations for Accessing Premium-Quality, No-Cost Audio Assets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/prime-cloud-call-recorder-pros/"><u>Prime Cloud Call Recorder Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-screen-capture-high-quality-snaps-with-ease/"><u>[Updated] How to Screen-Capture High-Quality Snaps with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-much-money-does-mr-beast-make/"><u>2024 Approved  How Much Money Does Mr. Beast Make</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
